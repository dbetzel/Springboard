      "To an extent this novel deals with the legal aspects of child custody in the State of Maine I asked for help in understanding this subject from my friend Warren Silver who is a fine attorney Warren guided me carefully and along the way he also told me about a quaint old device called the Stenomask which I immediately appropriated for my own fell purposes If Ive made procedural mistakes in the story which follows blame me not my legal resource Warren also asked merather plaintively if I could maybe put a good lawyer in my book All I can say is that I did my best in that regard Thanks to my son Owen for technical support in Woodstock New York and to my friend and fellow Rock Bottom Remainder Ridley Pearson for technical support in Ketchum Idaho Thanks to Pam Dorman for her sympathetic and perceptive reading of the first draft Thanks to Chuck Verrill for a monumental editing jobyour personal best Chuck Thanks to Susan Moldow Nan Graham Jack Roman s and Carolyn Reidy at Scribner for care and feeding And thanks to Tabby who was there for me again when things got hard I love you hon SK Yes Bartleby stay there behind your screen thought I I shall persecute you no more you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs in short I never feel so private as when I know you are here Bartleby HERMAN MELVILLE Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again    As I stood there hushed and still I could swear that the house was not an empty shell but lived and breathed as it had lived before Rebecca DAPHNE DU MAURIER On a very hot day in August of my wife told me she was going down to the Derry Rite Aid to pick up a refill on her sinus medicine prescription  this is stuff you can buy over the counter these days I believe Id finished my writing for the day and offered to pick it up for her She said thanks but she wanted to get a piece of fish at the supermarket next door anyway two birds with one stone and all of that She blew a kiss at me off the palm of her hand and went out The next time I saw her she was on TV Thats how you identify the dead here in Derry  no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the walls and long fluorescent bars overhead no naked body rolling out of a chilly drawer on casters you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope The Rite Aid and the Shopwell are less than a mile from our house in a little neighborhood strip mall which also supports a video store a usedbook store named Spread It Around they do a very brisk business in my old paperbacks a Radio Shack and a Fast Foto Its on UpMile Hill at the intersection of Witcham and Jackson She parked in front of Blockbuster Video went into the drugstore and did business with Mr Joe Wyzer who was the druggist in those days he has since moved on to the Rite Aid in Bangor At the checkout she picked up one of those little chocolates with marshmallow inside this one in the shape of a mouse I found it later in her purse I unwrapped it and ate it myself sitting at the kitchen table with the contents of her red handbag spread out in front of me and it was like taking Communion When it was gone except for the taste of chocolate on my tongue and in my throat I burst into tears I sat there in the litter of her Kleenex and makeup and keys and halffinished rolls of Certs and cried with my hands over my eyes the way a kid cries The sinus inhaler was in a Rite Aid bag It had cost twelve dollars and eighteen cents There was something else in the bag too  an item which had cost twentytwofifty I looked at this other item for a long time seeing it but not understanding it I was surprised maybe even stunned but the idea that Johanna Arlen Noonan might have been leading another life one I knew nothing about never crossed my mind Not then Jo left the register walked out into the bright hammering sun again swapping her regular glasses for her prescription sunglasses as she did and just as she stepped from beneath the drugstores slight overhang I am imagining a little here I suppose crossing over into the country of the novelist a little but not by much only by inches and you can trust me on that there was that shrewish howl of locked tires on pavement that means theres going to be either an accident or a very close call This time it happened  the sort of accident which happened at that stupid Xshaped intersection at least once a week it seemed A  Toyota was pulling out of the shoppingcenter parking lot and turning left onto Jackson Street Behind the wheel was Mrs Esther Easterling of Barretts Orchards She was accompanied by her friend Mrs Irene Deorsey also of Barretts Orchards who had shopped the video store without finding anything she wanted to rent Too much violence Irene said Both women were cigarette widows Esther could hardly have missed the orange Public Works dump truck coming down the hill although she denied this to the police to the newspaper and to me when I talked to her some two months later I think it likely that she just forgot to look As my own mother another cigarette widow used to say The two most common ailments of the elderly are arthritis and forgetfulness They cant be held responsible for neither Driving the Public Works truck was William Fraker of Old Cape Mr Fraker was thirtyeight years old on the day of my wifes death driving with his shirt off and thinking how badly he wanted a cool shower and a cold beer not necessarily in that order He and three other men had spent eight hours putting down asphalt patch out on the Harris Avenue Extension near the airport a hot job on a hot day and Bill Fraker said yeah he might have been going a little too fast  maybe forty in a thirtymileanhour zone He was eager to get back to the garage sign off on the truck and get behind the wheel of his own F which had air conditioning Also the dump trucks brakes while good enough to pass inspection were a long way from tiptop condition Fraker hit them as soon as he saw the Toyota pull out in front of him he hit his horn as well but it was too late He heard screaming tires  his own and Esthers as she belatedly realized her danger  and saw her face for just a moment That was the worst part somehow he told me as we sat on his porch drinking beers  it was October by then and although the sun was warm on our faces we were both wearing sweaters You know how high up you sit in one of those dump trucks  I nodded Well she was looking up to see me  craning up youd say  and the sun was full in her face I could see how old she was I remember thinking Holy shit shes gonna break like glass if I cant stop But old people are tough more often than not They can surprise you I mean look at how it turned out both those old biddies still alive and your wife     He stopped then bright red color dashing into his cheeks making him look like a boy who has been laughed at in the schoolyard by girls who have noticed his fly is unzipped It was comical but if Id smiled it only would have confused him Mr Noonan Im sorry My mouth just sort of ran away with me Its all right I told him Im over the worst of it anyway That was a lie but it put us back on track Anyway he said we hit There was a loud bang and a crumping sound when the drivers side of the car caved in Breaking glass too I was thrown against the wheel hard enough so I couldnt draw a breath without it hurting for a week or more and I had a big bruise right here He drew an arc on his chest just below the collarbones I banged my head on the windshield hard enough to crack the glass but all I got up there was a little purple knob    no bleeding not even a headache My wife says Ive just got a naturally thick skull I saw the woman driving the Toyota Mrs Easterling thrown across the console between the front bucket seats Then we were finally stopped all tangled together in the middle of the street and I got out to see how bad they were I tell you I expected to find them both dead Neither of them was dead neither of them was even unconscious although Mrs Easterling had three broken ribs and a dislocated hip Mrs Deorsey who had been a seat away from the impact suffered a concussion when she rapped her head on her window That was all she was treated and released at Home Hospital as the Derry News always puts it in such cases My wife the former Johanna Arlen of Malden Massachusetts saw it all from where she stood outside the drugstore with her purse slung over her shoulder and her prescription bag in one hand Like Bill Fraker she must have thought the occupants of the Toyota were either dead or seriously hurt The sound of the collision had been a hollow authoritative bang which rolled through the hot afternoon air like a bowling ball down an alley The sound of breaking glass edged it like jagged lace The two vehicles were tangled violently together in the middle of Jackson Street the dirty orange truck looming over the paleblue import like a bullying parent over a cowering child Johanna began to sprint across the parking lot toward the street Others were doing the same all around her One of them Miss Jill Dunbarry had been windowshopping at Radio Shack when the accident occurred She said she thought she remembered running past Johanna  at least she was pretty sure she remembered someone in yellow slacks  but she couldnt be sure By then Mrs Easterling was screaming that she was hurt they were both hurt wouldnt somebody help her and her friend Irene Halfway across the parking lot near a little cluster of newspaper dispensers my wife fell down Her pursestrap stayed over her shoulder but her prescription bag slipped from her hand and the sinus inhaler slid halfway out The other item stayed put No one noticed her lying there by the newspaper dispensers everyone was focused on the tangled vehicles the screaming women the spreading puddle of water and antifreeze from the Public Works trucks ruptured radiator Thats gas the clerk from Fast Foto shouted to anyone who would listen Thats gas watch out she dont blow fellas I suppose one or two of the wouldbe rescuers might have jumped right over her perhaps thinking she had fainted To assume such a thing on a day when the temperature was pushing ninetyfive degrees would not have been unreasonable Roughly two dozen people from the shopping center clustered around the accident another four dozen or so came running over from Strawford Park where a baseball game had been going on I imagine that all the things you would expect to hear in such situations were said many of them more than once Milling around Someone reaching through the misshapen hole which had been the driversside window to pat Esthers trembling old hand People immediately giving way for Joe Wyzer at such moments anyone in a white coat automatically becomes the belle of the ball In the distance the warble of an ambulance siren rising like shaky air over an incinerator All during this lying unnoticed in the parking lot was my wife with her purse still over her shoulder inside still wrapped in foil her uneaten chocolatemarshmallow mouse and her white prescription bag near one outstretched hand It was Joe Wyzer hurrying back to the pharmacy to get a compression bandage for Irene Deorseys head who spotted her He recognized her even though she was lying facedown He recognized her by her red hair white blouse and yellow slacks He recognized her because he had waited on her not fifteen minutes before Mrs Noonan he asked forgetting all about the compression bandage for the dazed but apparently not too badly hurt Irene Deorsey Mrs Noonan are you all right Knowing already or so I suspect perhaps I am wrong that she was not He turned her over It took both hands to do it and even then he had to work hard kneeling and pushing and lifting there in the parking lot with the heat baking down from above and then bouncing back up from the asphalt Dead people put on weight it seems to me both in their flesh and in our minds they put on weight There were red marks on her face When I identified her I could see them clearly even on the video monitor I started to ask the assistant medical examiner what they were but then I knew Late August hot pavement elementary my dear Watson My wife died getting a sunburn Wyzer got up saw that the ambulance had arrived and ran toward it He pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed one of the attendants as he got out from behind the wheel Theres a woman over there Wyzer said pointing toward the parking lot Guy weve got two women right here and a man as well the attendant said He tried to pull away but Wyzer held on Never mind them right now he said Theyre basically okay The woman over there isnt The woman over there was dead and Im pretty sure Joe Wyzer knew it    but he had his priorities straight Give him that And he was convincing enough to get both paramedics moving away from the tangle of truck and Toyota in spite of Esther Easterlings cries of pain and the rumbles of protest from the Greek chorus When they got to my wife one of the paramedics was quick to confirm what Joe Wyzer had already suspected Holy shit the other one said What happened to her Heart most likely the first one said She got excited and it just blew out on her But it wasnt her heart The autopsy revealed a brain aneurysm which she might have been living with all unknown for as long as five years As she sprinted across the parking lot toward the accident that weak vessel in her cerebral cortex had blown like a tire drowning her controlcenters in blood and killing her Death had probably not been instantaneous the assistant medical examiner told me but it had still come swiftly enough    and she wouldnt have suffered Just one big black nova all sensation and thought gone even before she hit the pavement Can I help you in any way Mr Noonan the assistant ME asked turning me gently away from the still face and closed eyes on the video monitor Do you have questions Ill answer them if I can Just one I said I told him what shed purchased in the drugstore just before she died Then I asked my question The days leading up to the funeral and the funeral itself are dreamlike in my memory  the clearest memory I have is of eating Jos chocolate mouse and crying    crying mostly I think because I knew how soon the taste of it would be gone I had one other crying fit a few days after we buried her and I will tell you about that one shortly I was glad for the arrival of Jos family and particularly for the arrival of her oldest brother Frank It was Frank Arlen  fifty redcheeked portly and with a head of lush dark hair  who organized the arrangements    who wound up actually dickering with the funeral director I cant believe you did that I said later as we sat in a booth at Jacks Pub drinking beers He was trying to stick it to you Mikey he said I hate guys like that He reached into his back pocket brought out a handkerchief and wiped absently at his cheeks with it He hadnt broken down  none of the Arlens broke down at least not when I was with them  but Frank had leaked steadily all day he looked like a man suffering from severe conjunctivitis There had been six Arlen sibs in all Jo the youngest and the only girl She had been the pet of her big brothers I suspect that if Id had anything to do with her death the five of them would have torn me apart with their bare hands As it was they formed a protective shield around me instead and that was good I suppose I might have muddled through without them but I dont know how I was thirtysix remember You dont expect to have to bury your wife when youre thirtysix and she herself is two years younger Death was the last thing on our minds If a guy gets caught taking your stereo out of your car they call it theft and put him in jail Frank said The Arlens had come from Massachusetts and I could still hear Malden in Franks voice  caught was coowat car was cah call was caul If the same guy is trying to sell a grieving husband a threethousanddollar casket for fortyfive hundred dollars they call it business and ask him to speak at the Rotary Club luncheon Greedy asshole I fed him his lunch didnt I Yes You did You okay Mikey Im okay Sincerely okay How the fuck should I know I asked him loud enough to turn some heads in a nearby booth And then She was pregnant His face grew very still What I struggled to keep my voice down Pregnant Six or seven weeks according to the    you know the autopsy Did you know Did she tell you No Christ no But there was a funny look on his face as if she had told him something I knew you were trying of course    she said you had a low sperm count and it might take a little while but the doctor thought you guysd probably    sooner or later youd probably     He trailed off looking down at his hands They can tell that huh They check for that They can tell As for checking I dont know if they do it automatically or not I asked Why She didnt just buy sinus medicine before she died She also bought one of those home pregnancytesting kits You had no idea No clue I shook my head He reached across the table and squeezed my shoulder She wanted to be sure thats all You know that dont you A refill on my sinus medicine and a piece of fish shed said Looking like always A woman off to run a couple of errands We had been trying to have a kid for eight years but she had looked just like always Sure I said patting Franks hand Sure big guy I know It was the Arlens  led by Frank who handled Johannas send off As the writer of the family I was assigned the obituary My brother came up from Virginia with my mom and my aunt and was allowed to tend the guestbook at the viewings My mother  almost completely gaga at the age of sixtysix although the doctors refused to call it Alzheimers  lived in Memphis with her sister two years younger and only slightly less wonky They were in charge of cutting the cake and the pies at the funeral reception Everything else was arranged by the Arlens from the viewing hours to the components of the funeral ceremony Frank and Victor the secondyoungest brother spoke brief tributes Jos dad offered a prayer for his daughters soul And at the end Pete Breedlove the boy who cut our grass in the summer and raked our yard in the fall brought everyone to tears by singing Blessed Assurance which Frank said had been Jos favorite hymn as a girl How Frank found Pete and persuaded him to sing at the funeral is something I never found out We got through it  the afternoon and evening viewings on Tuesday the funeral service on Wednesday morning then the little prayover at Fairlawn Cemetery What I remember most was thinking how hot it was how lost I felt without having Jo to talk to and that I wished I had bought a new pair of shoes Jo would have pestered me to death about the ones I was wearing if she had been there Later on I talked to my brother Sid told him we had to do something about our mother and Aunt Francine before the two of them disappeared completely into the Twilight Zone They were too young for a nursing home what did Sid advise He advised something but Ill be damned if I know what it was I agreed to it I remember that but not what it was Later that day Siddy our mom and our aunt climbed back into Siddys rental car for the drive to Boston where they would spend the night and then grab the Southern Crescent the following day My brother is happy enough to chaperone the old folks but he doesnt fly even if the tickets are on me He claims there are no breakdown lanes in the sky if the engine quits Most of the Arlens left the next day Once more it was doghot the sun glaring out of a whitehaze sky and lying on everything like melted brass They stood in front of our house  which had become solely my house by then  with three taxis lined up at the curb behind them big galoots hugging one another amid the litter of totebags and saying their goodbyes in those foggy Massachusetts accents Frank stayed another day We picked a big bunch of flowers behind the house  not those ghastlysmelling hothouse things whose aroma I always associate with death and organmusic but real flowers the kind Jo liked best  and stuck them in a couple of coffee cans I found in the back pantry We went out to Fairlawn and put them on the new grave Then we just sat there for awhile under the beating sun She was always just the sweetest thing in my life Frank said at last in a strange muffled voice We took care of Jo when we were kids Us guys No one messed with Jo Ill tell you Anyone tried wed feed em their lunch She told me a lot of stories Good ones Yeah real good Im going to miss her so much Me too I said Frank    listen    I know you were her favorite brother She never called you maybe just to say that she missed a period or was feeling whoopsy in the morning You can tell me I wont be pissed But she didnt Honest to God Was she whoopsy in the morning Not that I saw And that was just it I hadnt seen anything Of course Id been writing and when I write I pretty much trance out But she knew where I went in those trances She could have found me and shaken me fully awake Why hadnt she Why would she hide good news Not wanting to tell me until she was sure was plausible    but it somehow wasnt Jo Was it a boy or a girl he asked A girl Wed had names picked out and waiting for most of our marriage A boy would have been Andrew Our daughter would have been Kia Kia Jane Noonan Frank divorced six years and on his own had been staying with me On our way back to the house he said I worry about you Mikey You havent got much family to fall back on at a time like this and what you do have is far away Ill be all right I said He nodded Thats what we say anyway isnt it We Guys Ill be all right And if were not we try to make sure no one knows it He looked at me eyes still leaking handkerchief in one big sunburned hand If youre not all right Mikey and you dont want to call your brother  I saw the way you looked at him  let me be your brother For Jos sake if not your own Okay I said respecting and appreciating the offer also knowing I would do no such thing I dont call people for help Its not because of the way I was raised at least I dont think so its the way I was made Johanna once said that if I was drowning at Dark Score Lake where we have a summer home I would die silently fifty feet out from the public beach rather than yell for help Its not a question of love or affection I can give those and I can take them I feel pain like anyone else I need to touch and be touched But if someone asks me Are you all right I cant answer no I cant say help me A couple of hours later Frank left for the southern end of the state When he opened the car door I was touched to see that the taped book he was listening to was one of mine He hugged me then surprised me with a kiss on the mouth a good hard smack If you need to talk call he said And if you need to be with someone just come I nodded And be careful That startled me The combination of heat and grief had made me feel as if I had been living in a dream for the last few days but that got through Careful of what I dont know he said I dont know Mikey Then he got into his car  he was so big and it was so little that he looked as if he were wearing it  and drove away The sun was going down by then Do you know how the sun looks at the end of a hot day in August all orange and somehow squashed as if an invisible hand were pushing down on the top of it and at any moment it might just pop like an overfilled mosquito and splatter all over the horizon It was like that In the east where it was already dark thunder was rumbling But there was no rain that night only a dark that came down as thick and stifling as a blanket All the same I slipped in front of the word processor and wrote for an hour or so It went pretty well as I remember And you know even when it doesnt it passes the time My second crying fit came three or four days after the funeral That sense of being in a dream persisted  I walked I talked I answered the phone I worked on my book which had been about eighty percent complete when Jo died  but all the time there was this clear sense of disconnection a feeling that everything was going on at a distance from the real me that I was more or less phoning it in Denise Breedlove Petes mother called and asked if I wouldnt like her to bring a couple of her friends over one day the following week and give the big old Edwardian pile I now lived in alone  rolling around in it like the last pea in a restaurantsized can  a good stemtostern cleaning They would do it she said for a hundred dollars split even among the three of them and mostly because it wasnt good for me to go on without it There had to be a scrubbing after a death she said even if the death didnt happen in the house itself I told her it was a fine idea but I would pay her and the women she brought a hundred dollars each for six hours work At the end of the six hours I wanted the job done And if it wasnt I told her it would be done anyway Mr Noonan thats far too much she said Maybe and maybe not but its what Im paying I said Will you do it She said she would of course she would Perhaps predictably I found myself going through the house on the evening before they came doing a precleaning inspection I guess I didnt want the women two of whom would be complete strangers to me finding anything that would embarrass them or me a pair of Johannas silk panties stuffed down behind the sofa cushions perhaps We are often overcome on the sofa Michael she said to me once have you noticed or beer cans under the loveseat on the sunporch maybe even an unflushed toilet In truth I cant tell you any one thing I was looking for that sense of operating in a dream still held firm control over my mind The clearest thoughts I had during those days were either about the end of the novel I was writing the psychotic killer had lured my heroine to a highrise building and meant to push her off the roof or about the Norco Home Pregnancy Test Jo had bought on the day she died Sinus prescription she had said Piece of fish for supper she had said And her eyes had shown me nothing else I needed to look at twice Near the end of my precleaning I looked under our bed and saw an open paperback on Jos side She hadnt been dead long but few household lands are so dusty as the Kingdom of Underbed and the lightgray coating I saw on the book when I brought it out made me think of Johannas face and hands in her coffin  Jo in the Kingdom of Underground Did it get dusty inside a coffin Surely not but  I pushed the thought away It pretended to go but all day long it kept creeping back like Tolstoys white bear Johanna and I had both been English majors at the University of Maine and like many others I reckon we fell in love to the sound of Shakespeare and the Tilbury Town cynicism of Edwin Arlington Robinson Yet the writer who had bound us closest together was no collegefriendly poet or essayist but W Somerset Maugham that elderly globetrotting novelistplaywright with the reptiles face always obscured by cigarette smoke in his photographs it seems and the romantics heart So it did not surprise me much to find that the book under the bed was The Moon and Sixpence I had read it myself as a late teenager not once but twice identifying passionately with the character of Charles Strickland It was writing I wanted to do in the South Seas of course not painting She had been using a playing card from some defunct deck as her placemarker and as I opened the book I thought of something she had said when I was first getting to know her In TwentiethCentury British Lit this had been probably in  Johanna Arlen had been a fiery little sophomore I was a senior picking up the TwentiethCentury Brits simply because I had time on my hands that last semester A hundred years from now she had said the shame of the midtwentiethcentury literary critics will be that they embraced Lawrence and ignored Maugham This was greeted with contemptuously goodnatured laughter they all knew Women in Love was one of the greatest damn books ever written but I didnt laugh I fell in love The playing card marked pages  and   Dirk Stroeve has just discovered that his wife has left him for Strickland Maughams version of Paul Gauguin The narrator tries to buck Stroeve up My dear fellow dont be unhappy Shell come back    Easy for you to say I murmured to the room which now belonged just to me I turned the page and read this Stricklands injurious calm robbed Stroeve of his selfcontrol Blind rage seized him and without knowing what he was doing he flung himself on Strickland Strickland was taken by surprise and he staggered but he was very strong even after his illness and in a moment he did not exactly know how Stroeve found himself on the floor You funny little man said Strickland It occurred to me that Jo was never going to turn the page and hear Strickland call the pathetic Stroeve a funny little man In a moment of brilliant epiphany I have never forgotten  how could I it was one of the worst moments of my life  I understood it wasnt a mistake that would be rectified or a dream from which I would awaken Johanna was dead My strength was robbed by grief If the bed hadnt been there I would have fallen to the floor We weep from our eyes its all we can do but on that evening I felt as if every pore of my body were weeping every crack and cranny I sat there on her side of the bed with her dusty paperback copy of The Moon and Sixpence in my hand and I wailed I think it was surprise as much as pain in spite of the corpse I had seen and identified on a highresolution video monitor in spite of the funeral and Pete Breedlove singing Blessed Assurance in his high sweet tenor voice in spite of the graveside service with its ashes to ashes and dust to dust I hadnt really believed it The Penguin paperback did for me what the big gray coffin had not it insisted she was dead You funny little man said Strickland I lay back on our bed crossed my forearms over my face and cried myself to sleep that way as children do when theyre unhappy I had an awful dream In it I woke up saw the paperback of The Moon and Sixpence still lying on the coverlet beside me and decided to put it back under the bed where I had found it You know how confused dreams are  logic like Dal clocks gone so soft they lie over the branches of trees like throwrugs I put the playingcard bookmark back between pages  and   a turn of the index finger away from You funny little man said Strickland now and forever  and rolled onto my side hanging my head over the edge of the bed meaning to put the book back exactly where I had found it Jo was lying there amid the dustkitties A strand of cobweb hung down from the bottom of the box spring and caressed her cheek like a feather Her red hair looked dull but her eyes were dark and alert and baleful in her white face And when she spoke I knew that death had driven her insane Give me that she hissed Its my dustcatcher She snatched it out of my hand before I could offer it to her For a moment our fingers touched and hers were as cold as twigs after a frost She opened the book to her place the playing card fluttering out and placed Somerset Maugham over her face  a shroud of words As she crossed her hands on her bosom and lay still I realized she was wearing the blue dress I had buried her in She had come out of her grave to hide under our bed I awoke with a muffled cry and a painful jerk that almost tumbled me off the side of the bed I hadnt been asleep long  the tears were still damp on my cheeks and my eyelids had that funny stretched feel they get after a bout of weeping The dream had been so vivid that I had to roll on my side hang my head down and peer under the bed sure she would be there with the book over her face that she would reach out with her cold fingers to touch me There was nothing there of course  dreams are just dreams Nevertheless I spent the rest of the night on the couch in my study It was the right choice I guess because there were no more dreams that night Only the nothingness of good sleep I never suffered from writers block during the ten years of my marriage and did not suffer it immediately after Johannas death I was in fact so unfamiliar with the condition that it had pretty well set in before I knew anything out of the ordinary was going on I think this was because in my heart I believed that such conditions only affected literary types of the sort who are discussed deconstructed and sometimes dismissed in the New York Review of Books My writing career and my marriage covered almost exactly the same span I finished the first draft of my first novel Being Two not long after Jo and I became officially engaged I popped an opal ring on the third finger of her left hand a hundred and ten bucks at Days Jewellers and quite a bit more than I could afford at the time   but Johanna seemed utterly thrilled with it and I finished my last novel All the Way from the Top about a month after she was declared dead This was the one about the psychotic killer with the love of high places It was published in the fall of  I have published other novels since then  a paradox I can explain  but I dont think therell be a Michael Noonan novel on any list in the foreseeable future I know what writers block is now all right I know more about it than I ever wanted to When I hesitantly showed Jo the first draft of Being Two she read it in one evening curled up in her favorite chair wearing nothing but panties and a teeshirt with the Maine black bear on the front drinking glass after glass of iced tea I went out to the garage we were renting a house in Bangor with another couple on as shaky financial ground as we were  and no Jo and I werent quite married at that point although as far as I know that opal ring never left her finger and puttered aimlessly feeling like a guy in a New Yorker cartoon one of those about funny fellows in the delivery waiting room As I remember I fucked up a sosimpleachildcandoit birdhouse kit and almost cut off the index finger of my left hand Every twenty minutes or so Id go back inside and peek at Jo If she noticed she gave no sign I took that as hopeful I was sitting on the back stoop looking up at the stars and smoking when she came out sat down beside me and put her hand on the back of my neck Well I said Its good she said Now why dont you come inside and do me And before I could answer the panties she had been wearing dropped in my lap in a little whisper of nylon Afterward lying in bed and eating oranges a vice we later outgrew I asked her Good as in publishable Well she said I dont know anything about the glamorous world of publishing but Ive been reading for pleasure all my life  Curious George was my first love if you want to know   I dont She leaned over and popped an orange segment into my mouth her breast warm and provocative against my arm   and I read this with great pleasure My prediction is that your career as a reporter for the Derry News is never going to survive its rookie stage I think Im going to be a novelists wife Her words thrilled me  actually brought goosebumps out on my arms No she didnt know anything about the glamorous world of publishing but if she believed I believed    and belief turned out to be the right course I got an agent through my old creativewriting teacher who read my novel and damned it with faint praise seeing its commercial qualities as a kind of heresy I think and the agent sold Being Two to Random House the first publisher to see it Jo was right about my career as a reporter as well I spent four months covering flower shows drag races and bean suppers at about a hundred a week before my first check from Random House came in   after the agents commission had been deducted I wasnt in the newsroom long enough to get even that first minor bump in salary but they had a goingaway party for me just the same At Jacks Pub this was now that I think of it There was a banner hung over the tables in the back room which said GOOD LUCK MIKE  WRITE ON Later when we got home Johanna said that if envy was acid there would have been nothing left of me but my beltbuckle and three teeth Later in bed with the lights out  the last orange eaten and the last cigarette shared  I said No ones ever going to confuse it with Look Homeward Angel are they My book I meant She knew it just as she knew I had been fairly depressed by my old creativewriting teachers response to Two You arent going to pull a lot of frustratedartist crap on me are you she asked getting up on one elbow If you are I wish youd tell me now so I can pick up one of those doityourself divorce kits first thing in the morning I was amused but also a little hurt Did you see that first press release from Random House I knew she had Theyre just about calling me V C Andrews with a prick for Gods sake Well she said lightly grabbing the object in question you do have a prick As far as what theyre calling you    Mike when I was in third grade Patty Banning used to call me a boogerhooker But I wasnt Perception is everything Bullshit She was still holding my dick and now gave it a formidable squeeze that hurt a little and felt absolutely wonderful at the same time That crazy old trouser mouse never really cared what it got in those days as long as there was a lot of it Happiness is everything Are you happy when you write Mike Sure It was what she knew anyway And does your conscience bother you when you write When I write theres nothing Id rather do except this I said and rolled on top of her Oh dear she said in that prissy little voice that always cracked me up Theres a penis between us And as we made love I realized a wonderful thing or two that she had meant it when she said she really liked my book hell Id known she liked it just from the way she sat in the wing chair reading it with a lock of hair falling over her brow and her bare legs tucked beneath her and that I didnt need to be ashamed of what I had written    not in her eyes at least And one other wonderful thing her perception joined with my own to make the true binocular vision nothing but marriage allows was the only perception that mattered Thank God she was a Maugham fan I was V C Andrews with a prick for ten years    fourteen if you add in the postJohanna years The first five were with Random then my agent got a huge offer from Putnam and I jumped Youve seen my name on a lot of bestseller lists    if that is your Sunday paper carries a list that goes up to fifteen instead of just listing the top ten I was never a Clancy Ludlum or Grisham but I moved a fair number of hardcovers V C Andrews never did Harold Oblowski my agent told me once the lady was pretty much a paperback phenomenon and once got as high as number five on the Times list    that was with my second book The RedShirt Man Ironically one of the books that kept me from going higher was Steel Machine by Thad Beaumont writing as George Stark The Beaumonts had a summer place in Castle Rock back in those days not even fifty miles south of our place on Dark Score Lake Thads dead now Suicide I dont know if it had anything to do with writers block or not I stood just outside the magic circle of the megabestsellers but I never minded that We owned two homes by the time I was thirtyone the lovely old Edwardian in Derry and in western Maine a lakeside log home almost big enough to be called a lodge  that was Sara Laughs so called by the locals for nearly a century And we owned both places free and clear at a time of life when many couples consider themselves lucky just to have fought their way to mortgage approval on a starter home We were healthy faithful and with our funbones still fully attached I wasnt Thomas Wolfe not even Tom Wolfe or Tobias Wolff but I was being paid to do what I loved and theres no gig on earth better than that its like a license to steal I was what midlist fiction used to be in the forties critically ignored genreoriented in my case the genre was Lovely Young Woman on Her Own Meets Fascinating Stranger but well compensated and with the kind of shabby acceptance accorded to statesanctioned whorehouses in Nevada the feeling seeming to be that some outlet for the baser instincts should be provided and someone had to do That Sort of Thing I did That Sort of Thing enthusiastically and sometimes with Jos enthusiastic connivance if I came to a particularly problematic plot crossroads and at some point around the time of George Bushs election our accountant told us we were millionaires We werent rich enough to own a jet Grisham or a pro football team Clancy but by the standards of Derry Maine we were quite rolling in it We made love thousands of times saw thousands of movies read thousands of books Jo storing hers under her side of the bed at the end of the day more often than not And perhaps the greatest blessing was that we never knew how short the time was More than once I wondered if breaking the ritual is what led to the writers block In the daytime I could dismiss this as supernatural twaddle but at night that was harder to do At night your thoughts have an unpleasant way of slipping their collars and running free And if youve spent most of your adult life making fictions Im sure those collars are even looser and the dogs less eager to wear them Was it Shaw or Oscar Wilde who said a writer was a man who had taught his mind to misbehave And is it really so farfetched to think that breaking the ritual might have played a part in my sudden and unexpected unexpected by me at least silence When you make your daily bread in the land of makebelieve the line between what is and what seems to be is much finer Painters sometimes refuse to paint without wearing a certain hat and baseball players who are hitting well wont change their socks The ritual started with the second book which was the only one I remember being nervous about  I suppose Id absorbed a fair amount of that sophomorejinx stuff the idea that one hit might only be a fluke I remember an American Lit lecturers once saying that of modern American writers only Harper Lee had found a foolproof way of avoiding the secondbook blues When I reached the end of The RedShirt Man I stopped just short of finishing The Edwardian on Benton Street in Derry was still two years in the future at that point but we had purchased Sara Laughs the place on Dark Score not anywhere near as furnished as it later became and Jos studio not yet built but nice and thats where we were I pushed back from my typewriter  I was still clinging to my old IBM Selectric in those days  and went into the kitchen It was midSeptember most of the summer people were gone and the crying of the loons on the lake sounded inexpressibly lovely The sun was going down and the lake itself had become a still and heatless plate of fire This is one of the most vivid memories I have so clear I sometimes feel I could step right into it and live it all again What things if any would I do differently I sometimes wonder about that Early that evening I had put a bottle of Taittinger and two flutes in the fridge Now I took them out put them on a tin tray that was usually employed to transport pitchers of iced tea or KoolAid from the kitchen to the deck and carried it before me into the living room Johanna was deep in her ratty old easy chair reading a book not Maugham that night but William Denbrough one of her contemporary favorites Ooo she said looking up and marking her place Champagne whats the occasion As if you understand she didnt know Im done I said Mon livre est tout fini Well she said smiling and taking one of the flutes as I bent down to her with the tray then thats all right isnt it I realize now that the essence of the ritual  the part that was alive and powerful like the one true magic word in a mouthful of gibberish  was that phrase We almost always had champagne and she almost always came into the office with me afterward for the other thing but not always Once five years or so before she died she was in Ireland vacationing with a girlfriend when I finished a book I drank the champagne by myself that time and entered the last line by myself as well by then I was using a Macintosh which did a billion different things and which I used for only one and never lost a minutes sleep over it But I called her at the inn where she and her friend Bryn were staying I told her I had finished and listened as she said the words Id called to hear  words that slipped into an Irish telephone line travelled to a microwave transmitter rose like a prayer to some satellite and then came back down to my ear Well then thats all right isnt it This custom began as I say after the second book When wed each had a glass of champagne and a refill I took her into the office where a single sheet of paper still stuck out of my forestgreen Selectric On the lake one last loon cried down dark that call that always sounds to me like something rusty turning slowly in the wind I thought you said you were done she said Everything but the last line I said The book such as it is is dedicated to you and I want you to put down the last bit She didnt laugh or protest or get gushy just looked at me to see if I really meant it I nodded that I did and she sat in my chair She had been swimming earlier and her hair was pulled back and threaded through a white elastic thing It was wet and two shades darker red than usual I touched it It was like touching damp silk Paragraph indent she asked as seriously as a girl from the steno pool about to take dictation from the big boss No I said this continues And then I spoke the line Id been holding in my head ever since I got up to pour the champagneHe slipped the chain over her head and then the two of them walked down the steps to where the car was parked She typed it then looked around and up at me expectantly Thats it I said You can write The End I guess Jo hit the RETURN button twice centered the carriage and typed The End under the last line of prose the IBMs Courier type ball my favorite spinning out the letters in their obedient dance Whats the chain he slips over her head she asked me Youll have to read the book to find out With her sitting in my desk chair and me standing beside her she was in perfect position to put her face where she did When she spoke her lips moved against the most sensitive part of me There were a pair of cotton shorts between us and that was all Ve haff vays off making you talk she said Ill just bet you do I said I at least made a stab at the ritual on the day I finished All the Way from the Top It felt hollow form from which the magical substance had departed but Id expected that I didnt do it out of superstition but out of respect and love A kind of memorial if you will Or if you will Johannas real funeral service finally taking place a month after she was in the ground It was the last third of September and still hot  the hottest late summer I can remember All during that final sad push on the book I kept thinking how much I missed her    but that never slowed me down And heres something else hot as it was in Derry so hot I usually worked in nothing but a pair of boxer shorts I never once thought of going to our place at the lake It was as if my memory of Sara Laughs had been entirely wiped from my mind Perhaps that was because by the time I finished Top that truth was finally sinking in She wasnt just in Ireland this time My office at the lake is tiny but has a view The office in Derry is long booklined and windowless On this particular evening the overhead fans  there are three of them  were on and paddling at the soupy air I came in dressed in shorts a teeshirt and rubber thong sandals carrying a tin Coke tray with the bottle of champagne and the two chilled glasses on it At the far end of that railroadcar room under an eave so steep Id had to almost crouch so as not to bang my head when I got up over the years Id also had to withstand Jos protests that Id picked the absolute worst place in the room for a workstation the screen of my Macintosh glowed with words I thought I was probably inviting another storm of grief  maybe the worst storm  but I went ahead anyway    and our emotions always surprise us dont they There was no weeping and wailing that night I guess all that was out of my system Instead there was a deep and wretched sense of loss  the empty chair where she used to like to sit and read the empty table where she would always set her glass too close to the edge I poured a glass of champagne let the foam settle then picked it up Im done Jo I said as I sat there beneath the paddling fans So thats all right isnt it There was no response In light of all that came later I think thats worth repeating  there was no response I didnt sense as I later did that I was not alone in a room which appeared empty I drank the champagne put the glass back on the Coke tray then filled the other one I took it over to the Mac and sat down where Johanna would have been sitting if not for everyones favorite loving God No weeping and wailing but my eyes prickled with tears The words on the screen were these today wasnt so bad she supposed She crossed the grass to her car and laughed when she saw the white square of paper under the windshield Cam Delancey who refused to be discouraged or to take no for an answer had invited her to another of his Thursdaynight winetasting parties She took the paper started to tear it up then changed her mind and stuck it in the hip pocket of her jeans instead No paragraph indent I said this continues Then I keyboarded the line Id been holding in my head ever since I got up to get the champagne There was a whole world out there Cam Delanceys winetasting was as good a place to start as any I stopped looking at the little flashing cursor The tears were still prickling at the corners of my eyes but I repeat that there were no cold drafts around my ankles no spectral fingers at the nape of my neck I hit RETURN twice I clicked on CENTER I typed The End below the last line of prose and then I toasted the screen with what should have been Jos glass of champagne Heres to you babe I said I wish you were here I miss you like hell My voice wavered a little on that last word but didnt break I drank the Taittinger saved my final line of copy transferred the whole works to floppy disks then backed them up And except for notes grocery lists and checks that was the last writing I did for four years My publisher didnt know my editor Debra Weinstock didnt know my agent Harold Oblowski didnt know Frank Arlen didnt know either although on more than one occasion I had been tempted to tell him Let me be your brother For Jos sake if not your own he told me on the day he went back to his printing business and mostly solitary life in the southern Maine town of Sanford I had never expected to take him up on that and didnt not in the elemental cryforhelp way he might have been thinking about  but I phoned him every couple of weeks or so Guytalk you know  Hows it going Not too bad cold as a witchs tit Yeah here too You want to go down to Boston if I can get Bruins tickets Maybe next year pretty busy right now Yeah I know how that is seeya Mikey Okay Frank keep your weewee in the teepee Guytalk Im pretty sure that once or twice he asked me if I was working on a new book and I think I said  Oh fuck it  thats a lie okay One so ingrown that now Im even telling it to myself He asked all right and I always said yeah I was working on a new book it was going good real good I was tempted more than once to tell him I cant write two paragraphs without going into total mental and physical doglock  my heartbeat doubles then triples I get short of breath and then start to pant my eyes feel like theyre going to pop out of my head and hang there on my cheeks Im like a claustrophobe in a sinking submarine Thats how its going thanks for asking but I never did I dont call for help I cant call for help I think I told you that From my admittedly prejudiced standpoint successful novelists  even modestly successful novelists  have got the best gig in the creative arts Its true that people buy more CDS than books go to more movies and watch a lot more TV But the arc of productivity is longer for novelists perhaps because readers are a little brighter than fans of the nonwritten arts and thus have marginally longer memories David Soul of Starsky and Hutch is God knows where same with that peculiar white rapper Vanilla Ice but in  Herman Wouk James Michener and Norman Mailer were all still around talk about when dinosaurs walked the earth Arthur Hailey was writing a new book that was the rumor anyway and it turned out to be true Thomas Harris could take seven years between Lecters and still produce bestsellers and although not heard from in almost forty years J D Salinger was still a hot topic in English classes and informal coffeehouse literary groups Readers have a loyalty that cannot be matched anywhere else in the creative arts which explains why so many writers who have run out of gas can keep coasting anyway propelled onto the bestseller lists by the magic words AUTHOR OF on the covers of their books What the publisher wants in return especially from an author who can be counted on to sell  or so copies of each novel in hardcover and a million more in paperback is perfectly simple a book a year That the wallahs in New York have determined is the optimum Three hundred and eighty pages bound by string or glue every twelve months a beginning a middle and an end continuing main character like Kinsey Millhone or Kay Scarpetta optional but very much preferred Readers love continuing characters its like coming back to family Less than a book a year and youre screwing up the publishers investment in you hampering your business managers ability to continue floating all of your credit cards and jeopardizing your agents ability to pay his shrink on time Also theres always some fan attrition when you take too long Cant be helped Just as if you publish too much there are readers wholl say Phew Ive had enough of this guy for awhile its all starting to taste like beans I tell you all this so youll understand how I could spend four years using my computer as the worlds most expensive Scrabble board and no one ever suspected Writers block What writers block We dont got no steenkin writers block How could anyone think such a thing when there was a new Michael Noonan suspense novel appearing each fall just like clockwork perfect for your latesummer pleasure reading folks and by the way dont forget that the holidays are coming and that all your relatives would also probably enjoy the new Noonan which can he had at Borders at a thirty percent discount oy vay such a deal The secret is simple and I am not the only popular novelist in America who knows it  if the rumors are correct Danielle Steel to name just one has been using the Noonan Formula for decades You see although I have published a book a year starting with Being Two in  I wrote two books in four of those ten years publishing one and ratholing the other I dont remember ever talking about this with Jo and since she never asked I always assumed she understood what I was doing saving up nuts It wasnt writers block I was thinking of though Shit I was just having fun By February of  after crashing and burning with at least two good ideas that particular function  the Eureka thing  has never stopped which creates its own special version of hell I could no longer deny the obvious I was in the worst sort of trouble a writer can get into barring Alzheimers or a cataclysmic stroke Still I had four cardboard manuscript boxes in the big safedeposit box I keep up at Fidelity Union They were marked Promise Threat Darcy and Top Around Valentines Day my agent called moderately nervous  I usually delivered my latest masterpiece to him by January and here it was already halfpast February They would have to crash production to get this years Mike Noonan out in time for the annual Christmas buying orgy Was everything all right This was my first chance to say things were a country mile from all but Mr Harold Oblowski of  Park Avenue wasnt the sort of man you said such things to He was a fine agent both liked and loathed in publishing circles sometimes by the same people at the same time but he didnt adapt well to bad news from the dark and oiltreaked levels where the goods were actually produced He would have freaked and been on the next plane to Derry ready to give me creative mouthtomouth adamant in his resolve not to leave until he had yanked me out of my fugue No I liked Harold right where he was in his thirtyeighthfloor office with its kickass view of the East Side I told him what a coincidence Harold you calling on the very day I finished the new one gosharooty how bout that Ill send it out FedEx youll have it tomorrow Harold assured me solemnly that there was no coincidence about it that where his writers were concerned he was telepathic Then he congratulated me and hung up Two hours later I received his bouquetevery bit as fulsome and silky as one of his Jimmy Hollywood ascots After putting the flowers in the dining room where I rarely went since Jo died I went down to Fidelity Union I used my key the bank manager used his and soon enough I was on my way to FedEx with the manuscript of All the Way from the Top I took the most recent book because it was the one closest to the front of the box thats all In November it was published just in time for the Christmas rush I dedicated it to the memory of my late beloved wife Johanna It went to number eleven on the Times bestseller list and everyone went home happy Even me Because things would get better wouldnt they No one had terminal writers block did they well with the possible exception of Harper Lee All I had to do was relax as the chorus girl said to the archbishop And thank God Id been a good squirrel and saved up my nuts I was still optimistic the following year when I drove down to the Federal Express office with Threatening Behavior That one was written in the fall of  and had been one of Jos favorites Optimism had faded quite a little bit by March of  when I drove through a wet snowstorm with Darcys Admirer although when people asked me how it was going Writing any good books lately is the existential way most seem to phrase the question I still answered good fine yeah writing lots of good books lately theyre pouring out of me like shit out of a cows ass After Harold had read Darcy and pronounced it my best ever a bestseller which was also serious I hesitantly broached the idea of taking a year off He responded immediately with the question I detest above all others was I all right Sure I told him fine as freckles just thinking about easing off a little There followed one of those patented Harold Oblowski silences which were meant to convey that you were being a terrific asshole but because Harold liked you so much he was trying to think of the gentlest possible way of telling you so This is a wonderful trick but one I saw through about six years ago Actually it was Jo who saw through it Hes only pretending compassion she said Actually hes like a cop in one of those old film noir movies keeping his mouth shut so youll blunder ahead and end up confessing to everything This time I kept my mouth shut  just switched the phone from my right ear to my left and rocked back a little further in my office chair When I did my eye fell on the framed photograph over my computer  Sara Laughs our place on Dark Score Lake I hadnt been there in eons and for a moment I consciously wondered why Then Harolds voice  cautious comforting the voice of a sane man trying to talk a lunatic out of what he hopes will be no more than a passing delusion  was back in my ear That might not be a good idea Mike  not at this stage of your career This isnt a stage I said I peaked in   since then my sales havent really gone up or down This is a plateau Harold Yes he said and writers whove reached that steady state really only have two choices in terms of sales  they can continue as they are or they can go down So I go down I thought of saying    but didnt I didnt want Harold to know exactly how deep this went or how shaky the ground under me was I didnt want him to know that I was now having heart palpitationsyes I mean this literally  almost every time I opened the Word Six program on my computer and looked at the blank screen and flashing cursor Yeah I said Okay Message received Youre sure youre all right Does the book read like Im wrong Harold Hell no  its a helluva yarn Your personal best I told you A great read but also fucking serious shit If Saul Bellow wrote romantic suspense fiction this is what hed write But    youre not having any trouble with the next one are you I know youre still missing Jo hell we all are   No I said No trouble at all Another of those long silences ensued I endured it At last Harold said Grisham could afford to take a year off Clancy could Thomas Harris the long silences are a part of his mystique But where you are life is even tougher than at the very top Mike There are five writers for every one of those spots down on the list and you know who they are  hell theyre your neighbors three months a year Some are going up the way Patricia Cornwell went up with her last two books some are going down and some are staying steady like you If Tom Clancy were to go on hiatus for five years and then bring Jack Ryan back hed come back strong no argument If you go on hiatus for five years maybe you dont come back at all My advice is   Make hay while the sun shines Took the words right out of my mouth We talked a little more then said our goodbyes I leaned back further in my office chair  not all the way to the tip over point but close  and looked at the photo of our western Maine retreat Sara Laughs sort of like the title of that hoary old Hall and Oates ballad Jo had loved it more true enough but only by a little so why had I been staying away Bill Dean the caretaker took down the storm shutters every spring and put them back up every fall drained the pipes in the fall and made sure the pump was running in the spring checked the generator and took care to see that all the maintenance tags were current anchored the swimming float fifty yards or so off our little lick of beach after each Memorial Day Bill had the chimney cleaned in the early summer of  although there hadnt been a fire in the fireplace for two years or more I paid him quarterly as is the custom with caretakers in that part of the world Bill Dean old Yankee from a long line of them cashed my checks and didnt ask why I never used my place anymore Id only been down two or three times since Jo died and not a single overnight Good thing Bill didnt ask because I dont know what answer I would have given him I hadnt even really thought about Sara Laughs until my conversation with Harold Thinking of Harold I looked away from the photo and back at the phone Imagined saying to him So I go down so what The world comes to an end Please It isnt as if I had a wife and family to support  the wife died in a drugstore parking lot if you please or even if you dont please and the kid we wanted so badly and tried for so long went with her I dont crave the fame either  if writers who fill the lower slots on the Times bestseller list can be said to be famous  and I dont fall asleep dreaming of book club sales So why Why does it even bother me But that last one I could answer Because it felt like giving up Because without my wife and my work I was a superfluous man living alone in a big house that was all paid for doing nothing but the newspaper crossword over lunch I pushed on with what passed for my life I forgot about Sara Laughs or some part of me that didnt want to go there buried the idea and spent another sweltering miserable summer in Derry I put a cruciverbalist program on my Powerbook and began making my own crossword puzzles I took an interim appointment on the local YMCAs board of directors and judged the Summer Arts Competition in Waterville I did a series of TV ads for the local homeless shelter which was staggering toward bankruptcy then served on that board for awhile At one public meeting of this latter board a woman called me a friend of degenerates to which I replied Thanks I needed that This resulted in a loud outburst of applause which I still dont understand I tried some oneonone counselling and gave it up after five appointments deciding that the counsellors problems were far worse than mine I sponsored an Asian child and bowled with a league Sometimes I tried to write and every time I did I locked up Once when I tried to force a sentence or two any sentence or two just as long as they came freshbaked out of my own head I had to grab the wastebasket and vomit into it I vomited until I thought it was going to kill me    and I did have to literally crawl away from the desk and the computer pulling myself across the deeppile rug on my hands and knees By the time I got to the other side of the room it was better I could even look back over my shoulder at the VDT screen I just couldnt get near it Later that day I approached it with my eyes shut and turned it off More and more often during those latesummer days I thought of Dennison Carville the creativewriting teacher whod helped me connect with Harold and who had damned Being Two with such faint praise Camille once said something I never forgot attributing it to Thomas Hardy the Victorian novelist and poet Perhaps Hardy did say it but Ive never found it repeated not in Bartletts not in the Hardy biography I read between the publications of All the Way from the Top and Threatening Behavior I have an idea Carville may have made it up himself and then attributed it to Hardy in order to give it more weight Its a ploy I have used myself from time to time Im ashamed to say In any case I thought about this quote more and more as I struggled with the panic in my body and the frozen feeling in my head that awful lockedup feeling It seemed to sum up my despair and my growing certainty that I would never be able to write again what a tragedy V C Andrews with a prick felled by writers block It was this quote that suggested any effort I made to better my situation might be meaningless even if it succeeded According to gloomy old Dennison Carville the aspiring novelist should understand from the outset that fictions goals were forever beyond his reach that the job was an exercise in futility Compared to the dullest human being actually walking about on the face of the earth and casting his shadow there Hardy supposedly said the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones I understood because that was what I felt like in those interminable dissembling days a bag of bones Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again If there is any more beautiful and haunting first line in English fiction Ive never read it And it was a line I had cause to think of a lot during the fall of  and the winter of  I didnt dream of Manderley of course but of Sara Laughs which Jo sometimes called the hideout A fair enough description I guess for a place so far up in the western Maine woods that its not really even in a town at all but in an unincorporated area designated on state maps as RR The last of these dreams was a nightmare but until that one they had a kind of surreal simplicity They were dreams Id awake from wanting to turn on the bedroom light so I could reconfirm my place in reality before going back to sleep You know how the air feels before a thunderstorm how everything gets still and colors seem to stand out with the brilliance of things seen during a high fever My winter dreams of Sara Laughs were like that each leaving me with a feeling that was not quite sickness Ive dreamt again of Manderley I would think sometimes and sometimes I would lie in bed with the light on listening to the wind outside looking into the bedrooms shadowy corners and thinking that Rebecca de Winter hadnt drowned in a bay but in Dark Score Lake That she had gone down gurgling and flailing her strange black eyes full of water while the loons cried out indifferently in the twilight Sometimes I would get up and drink a glass of water Sometimes I just turned off the light after I was once more sure of where I was rolled over on my side again and went back to sleep In the daytime I rarely thought of Sara Laughs at all and it was only much later that I realized something is badly out of whack when there is such a dichotomy between a persons waking and sleeping lives I think that Harold Oblowskis call in October of  was what kicked off the dreams Harolds ostensible reason for calling was to congratulate me on the impending release of Darcys Admirer which was entertaining as hell and which also contained some extremely thoughtprovoking shit I suspected he had at least one other item on his agenda  Harold usually does  and I was right Hed had lunch with Debra Weinstock my editor the day before and they had gotten talking about the fall of  Looks crowded he said meaning the fall lists meaning specifically the fiction half of the fall lists And there are some surprise additions Dean Koontz   I thought he usually published in January I said He does but Debra hears this one may be delayed He wants to add a section or something Also theres a Harold Robbins The Predators   Big deal Robbins still has his fans Mike still has his fans As you yourself have pointed out on more than one occasion fiction writers have a long arc Uhhuh I switched the telephone to the other ear and leaned back in my chair I caught a glimpse of the framed Sara Laughs photo over my desk when I did I would be visiting it at greater length and proximity that night in my dreams although I didnt know that then all I knew then was that I wished like almighty fuck that Harold Oblowski would hurry up and get to the point I sense impatience Michael my boy Harold said Did I catch you at your desk Are you writing Just finished for the day I said I am thinking about lunch however Ill be quick he promised but hang with me this is important There may be as many as five other writers that we didnt expect publishing next fall Ken Follett    its supposed to be his best since Eye of the Needle    Belva Plain    John Jakes     None of those guys plays tennis on my court I said although I knew that was not exactly Harolds point Harolds point was that there are only fifteen slots on the Times list How about Jean Auel finally publishing the next of her sexamongthecavepeople epics I sat up Jean Auel Really Well    not a hundred percent but it looks good Last but not least is a new Mary Higgins Clark I know what tennis court she plays on and so do you If Id gotten that sort of news six or seven years earlier when Id felt I had a great deal more to protect I would have been frothing Mary Higgins Clark did play on the same court shared exactly the same audience and so far our publishing schedules had been arranged to keep us out of each others way    which was to my benefit rather than hers let me assure you Going nose to nose she would cream me As the late Jim Croce so wisely observed you dont tug on Supermans cape you dont spit into the wind you dont pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger and you dont mess around with Mary Higgins Clark Not if youre Michael Noonan anyway How did this happen I asked I dont think my tone was particularly ominous but Harold replied in the nervous stumblingalloverhisownwords fashion of a man who suspects he may be fired or even beheaded for bearing evil tidings I dont know She just happened to get an extra idea this year I guess That does happen Ive been told As a fellow who had taken his share of doubledips I knew it did so I simply asked Harold what he wanted It seemed the quickest and easiest way to get him to relinquish the phone The answer was no surprise what he and Debra both wanted  not to mention all the rest of my Putnam pals  was a book they could publish in late summer of  thus getting in front of Ms Clark and the rest of the competition by a couple of months Then in November the Putnam sales reps would give the novel a healthy second push with the Christmas season in mind So they say I replied Like most novelists and in this regard the successful are no different from the unsuccessful indicating there might be some merit to the idea as well as the usual freefloating paranoia I never trusted publishers promises I think you can believe them on this Mike  Darcys Admirer was the last book of your old contract remember Harold sounded almost sprightly at the thought of forthcoming contract negotiations with Debra Weinstock and Phyllis Grann at Putnam The big thing is they still like you Theyd like you even more I think if they saw pages with your name on them before Thanksgiving They want me to give them the next book in November Next month I injected what I hoped was the right note of incredulity into my voice just as if I hadnt had Helens Promise in a safedeposit box for almost eleven years It had been the first nut I had stored it was now the only nut I had left No no you could have until January fifteenth at least he said trying to sound magnanimous I found myself wondering where he and Debra had gotten their lunch Some fly place I would have bet my life on that Maybe Four Seasons Johanna always used to call that place Valli and the Four Seasons It means theyd have to crash production seriously crash it but theyre willing to do that The real question is whether or not you could crash production I think I could but itll cost em I said Tell them to think of it as being like sameday service on your drycleaning Oh what a rotten shame for them Harold sounded as if he were maybe jacking off and had reached the point where Old Faithful splurts and everybody snaps their Instamatics How much do you think   A surcharge tacked on to the advance is probably the way to go he said Theyll get pouty of course claim that the move is in your interest too Primarily in your interest even But based on the extrawork argument    the midnight oil youll have to burn     The mental agony of creation    the pangs of premature birth     Right    right    I think a ten percent surcharge sounds about right He spoke judiciously like a man trying to be just as damned fair as he possibly could Myself I was wondering how many women would induce birth a month or so early if they got paid two or three hundred grand extra for doing so Probably some questions are best left unanswered And in my case what difference did it make The goddam thing was written wasnt it Well see if you can make the deal I said Yes but I dont think we want to be talking about just a single book here okay I think   Harold what I want right now is to eat some lunch You sound a little tense Michael Is everything   Everything is fine Talk to them about just one book with a sweetener for speeding up production at my end Okay Okay he said after one of his most significant pauses But I hope this doesnt mean that you wont entertain a three or fourbook contract later on Make hay while the sun shines remember Its the motto Of champions Cross each bridge when you come to it is the motto of champions I said and that night I dreamt I went to Sara Laughs again In that dream  in all the dreams I had that fall and winter  I am walking up the lane to the lodge The lane is a twomile loop through the woods with ends opening onto Route  It has a number at either end Lane Fortytwo if it matters in case you have to call in a fire but no name Nor did Jo and I ever give it one not even between ourselves It is narrow really just a double rut with timothy and witchgrass growing on the crown When you drive in you can hear that grass whispering like low voices against the undercarriage of your car or truck I dont drive in the dream though I never drive In these dreams I walk The trees huddle in close on either side of the lane The darkening sky overhead is little more than a slot Soon I will be able to see the first peeping stars Sunset is past Crickets chirr Loons cry on the lake Small things  chipmunks probably or the occasional squirrel  rustle in the woods Now I come to a dirt driveway sloping down the hill on my right It is our driveway marked with a little wooden sign which reads SARA LAUGHS I stand at the head of it but I dont go down Below is the lodge Its all logs and addedon wings with a deck jutting out behind Fourteen rooms in all a ridiculous number of rooms It should look ugly and awkward but somehow it does not There is a bravedowager quality to Sara the look of a lady pressing resolutely on toward her hundredth year still taking pretty good strides in spite of her arthritic hips and gimpy old knees The central section is the oldest dating back to  or so Other sections were added in the thirties forties and sixties Once it was a hunting lodge for a brief period in the early seventies it was home to a small commune of transcendental hippies These were lease or rental deals the owners from the late forties until  were the Hingermans Darren and Marie    then Marie alone when Darren died in  The only visible addition from our period of ownership is the tiny DSS dish mounted on the central roofpeak That was Johannas idea and she never really got a chance to enjoy it Beyond the house the lake glimmers in the afterglow of sunset The driveway I see is carpeted with brown pine needles and littered with fallen branches The bushes which grow on either side of it have run wild reaching out to one another like lovers across the narrowed gap which separates them If you brought a car down here the branches would scrape and unpleasantly against its sides Below I see theres moss growing logs of the main house and three large sunflowers with faces like have grown up through the boards of the little drivewayside The overall feeling is not neglect exactly but forgottenness There is a breath of breeze and its coldness on my skin makes me that I have been sweating I can smell pine  a smell which is sour and clean at the same time  and the faint but somehow smell of the lake Dark Score is one of the cleanest deepest in Maine It was bigger until the late thirties Marie Hingerman us that was when Western Maine Electric working hand in hand the mills and paper operations around Rumford had gotten state to dam the Gessa River Marie also showed us some charming photographs of whitefrocked ladies and vested gentlemen in canoes  snaps were from the time of the First World War she said and to one of the young women frozen forever on the rim of the with a dripping paddle upraised Thats my mother she said the man shes threatening with the paddle is my father Loons crying their voices like loss Now I can see Venus in the darksky Star light star bright wish I may wish I might    in these I always wish for Johanna With my wish made I try to walk down the driveway Of course I do Its my house isnt it Where else would I go but my house now that dark and now that the stealthy rustling in the woods seems closer and somehow more purposeful Where else can I go Its dark and it will be frightening to go into that dark place alone suppose been left so long alone suppose shes angry but I must If the electricitys off Ill light one of the hurricane lamps we keep in a kitchen cabinet I cant go down My legs wont move Its as if my body knows something about the house down there that my brain does not The breeze rises again chilling gooseflesh out onto my skin and I wonder what I have done to get myself all sweaty like this Have I been running And if so what have I been running toward Or from My hair is sweaty too it lies on my brow in an unpleasantly heavy clump I raise my hand to brush it away and see there is a shallow cut fairly recent running across the back just beyond the knuckles Sometimes this cut is on my right hand sometimes its on the left I think If this is a dream the details are good Always that same thought If this is a dream the details are good Its the absolute truth They are a novelists details    but in dreams perhaps everyone is a novelist How is one to know Now Sara Laughs is only a dark hulk down below and I realize I dont want to go down there anyway I am a man who has trained his mind to misbehave and I can imagine too many things waiting for me inside A rabid raccoon crouched in a corner of the kitchen Bats in the bathroom  if disturbed theyll crowd the air around my cringing face squeaking and fluttering against my cheeks with their dusty wings Even one of William Denbroughs famous Creatures from Beyond the Universe now hiding under the porch and watching me approach with glittering pusrimmed eyes Well I cant stay up here I say but my legs wont move and it seems I will be staying up here where the driveway meets the lane that I will be staying up here like it or not Now the rustling in the woods behind me sounds not like small animals most of them would by then be nested or burrowed for the night anyway but approaching footsteps I try to turn and see but I cant even do that       and that was where I usually woke up The first thing I always did was to turn over establishing my return to reality by demonstrating to myself that my body would once more obey my mind Sometimes  most times actually  I would find myself thinking Manderley I have dreamt again of Manderley There was something creepy about this theres something creepy about any repeating dream I think about knowing your subconscious is digging obsessively at some object that wont be dislodged but I would be lying if I didnt add that some part of me enjoyed the breathless summer calm in which the dream always wrapped me and that part also enjoyed the sadness and foreboding I felt when I awoke There was an exotic strangeness to the dream that was missing from my waking life now that the road leading out of my imagination was so effectively blocked The only time I remember being really frightened and I must tell I dont completely trust any of these memories because for so long they didnt seem to exist at all was when I awoke one night speaking clearly into the dark of my bedroom Somethings behind me dont let it get me something in the woods please dont let it get me wasnt the words themselves that frightened me so much as the tone in which they were spoken It was the voice of a man on the raw edge of panic and hardly seemed like my own voice at all Two days before Christmas of  I once more drove down to Fidelity where once more the bank manager escorted me to my safebox in the fluorescentlit catacombs As we walked down the stairs he assured me for the dozenth time at least that his wife was a huge fan of my work shed read all my books couldnt get enough For the dozenth time at least I replied that now I must get him in my clutches He responded with his usual chuckle I thought of this oftrepeated exchange as Bankers Communion Mr Quinlan inserted his key in Slot A and turned it Then as discreetly as a pimp who has conveyed a customer to a whores crib he left I inserted my own key in Slot B turned it and opened the drawer It very vast now The one remaining manuscript box seemed almost to quail in the far corner like an abandoned puppy who somehow knows his sibs have been taken off and gassed Promise was scrawled across the top in fat black letters I could barely remember what the goddam story was about I snatched that timetraveller from the eighties and slammed the box shut Nothing left in there now but dust Give me that Jo had hissed in my dream  it was the first time Id thought of that one in years Give me that its my dustcatcher Mr Quinlan Im finished I called My voice sounded rough and unsteady to my own ears but Quinlan seemed to sense nothing wrong    or perhaps he was just being discreet I cant have been the only customer after all who found his or her visits to this financial version of Forest Lawn emotionally distressful Im really going to read one of your books he said dropping an involuntary little glance at the box I was holding I suppose I could have brought a briefcase to put it in but on those expeditions I never did In fact I think Ill put it on my list of New Years resolutions You do that I said You just do that Mr Quinlan Mark he said Please Hed said this before too I had composed two letters which I slipped into the manuscript box before setting out for Federal Express Both had been written on my computer which my body would let me use as long as I chose the Note Pad function It was only opening Word Six that caused the storms to start I never tried to compose a novel using the Note Pad function understanding that if I did Id likely lose that option too    not to mention my ability to play Scrabble and do crosswords on the machine I had tried a couple of times to compose longhand with spectacular lack of success The problem wasnt what I had once heard described as screen shyness I had proved that to myself One of the notes was to Harold the other to Debra Weinstock and both said pretty much the same thing heres the new book Helens Promise hope you like it as much as I do if it seems a little rough its because I had to work a lot of extra hours to finish it this soon Merry Christmas Happy Hanukkah Erin Go Bragh trick or treat hope someone gives you a fucking pony I stood for almost an hour in a line of shuffling bittereyed late mailers Christmas is such a carefree lowpressure time  thats one of the things I love about it with Helens Promise under my left arm and a paperback copy of Nelson DeMilles The Charm School in my right hand I read almost fifty pages before entrusting my final unpublished novel to a harriedlooking clerk When I wished her a Merry Christmas she shuddered and said nothing The phone was ringing when I walked in my front door It was Frank asking me if Id like to join him for Christmas Join them as matter of fact all of his brothers and their families were coming I opened my mouth to say no the last thing on earth I needed was a Irish Christmas with everybody drinking whiskey and waxing sentimental about Jo while perhaps two dozen snotcaked rugrats crawled around the floor  and heard myself saying Id come Frank sounded as surprised as I felt but honestly delighted Fantastic He cried When can you get here I was in the hall my galoshes dripping on the tile and from where I standing I could look through the arch and into the living room There was no Christmas tree I hadnt bothered with one since Jo died The room looked both ghastly and much too big to me    a roller rink furnished in Early American Ive been out running errands I said How about I throw some in a bag get back into the car and come south while the still blowing warm air Tremendous Frank said without a moments hesitation We can have us a sane bachelor evening before the Sons and Daughters of East Malden start arriving Im pouring you a drink as soon as I get off the telephone Then I guess I better get rolling I said That was hands down the best holiday since Johanna died The only good holiday I guess For four days I was an honorary Arlen I drank too much toasted Johannas memory too many times    and knew somehow that shed be pleased to know I was doing it Two babies spit up on me one dog got into bed with me in the middle of the night and Nicky Arlens sisterinlaw made a bleary pass at me on the night after Christmas when she caught me alone in the kitchen making a turkey sandwich I kissed her because she clearly wanted to be kissed and an adventurous or perhaps mischievous is the word I want hand groped me for a moment in a place where no one other than myself had groped in almost three and a half years It was a shock but not an entirely unpleasant one It went no further  in a houseful of Arlens and with Susy Donahue not quite officially divorced yet like me she was an honorary Arlen that Christmas it hardly could have done  but I decided it was time to leave    unless that was I wanted to go driving at high speed down a narrow street that most likely ended in a brick wall I left on the twentyseventh very glad that I had come and I gave Frank a fierce goodbye hug as we stood by my car For four days I hadnt thought at all about how there was now only dust in my safedeposit box at Fidelity Union and for four nights I had slept straight through until eight in the morning sometimes waking up with a sour stomach and a hangover headache but never once in the middle of the night with the thought Manderley I have dreamt again of Manderley going through my mind I got back to Derry feeling refreshed and renewed The first day of  dawned clear and cold and still and beautiful I got up showered then stood at the bedroom window drinking coffee It suddenly occurred to me  with all the simple powerful reality of ideas like up is over your head and down is under your feet  that I could write now It was a new year something had changed and I could write now if I wanted to The rock had rolled away I went into the study sat down at the computer and turned it on My heart was beating normally there was no sweat on my forehead or the back of my neck and my hands were warm I pulled down the main menu the one you get when you click on the apple and there was my Word Six I clicked on it The penandparchment logo came up and when it did I suddenly couldnt breathe It was as if iron bands had clamped around my chest I pushed back from the desk gagging and clawing at the round neck of the sweatshirt I was wearing The wheels of my office chair caught on little throw rug  one of Jos finds in the last year of her life  and I tipped right over backward My head banged the floor and I saw a fountain of bright sparks go whizzing across my field of vision I suppose I was lucky to black out but I think my real luck on New Years Morning of  was that I tipped over the way I did If Id only pushed back from the desk so that I was still looking at the logo  and at the hideous blank screen followed it  I think I might have choked to death When I staggered to my feet I was at least able to breathe My throat the size of a straw and each inhale made a weird screaming sound but I was breathing I lurched into the bathroom and threw up in the basin with such force that vomit splashed the mirror I grayed out and my knees buckled This time it was my brow I struck thunking it against the lip of the basin and although the back of my head didnt bleed there was a very respectable lump there by noon though my forehead did a little This latter bump also left a purple mark which I of course lied about telling folks who asked that Id run into the bathroom door in the middle of the night silly me thatll teach a fella to get up at two AM without turning on a lamp When I regained complete consciousness if there is such a state I was curled up on the floor I got up disinfected the cut on my forehead and sat on the lip of the tub with my head lowered to my knees until I felt confident enough to stand up I sat there for fifteen minutes I guess and in that space of time I decided that barring some miracle my career was over Harold would scream in pain and Debra would moan in disbelief but what could they do Send out the Publication Police me with the BookoftheMonthClub Gestapo Even if they could what difference would it make You couldnt get sap out of a brick or blood out of a stone Barring some miraculous recovery my life as a writer was over And if it is I asked myself Whats on for the back forty Mike You can play a lot of Scrabble in forty years go on a lot of Crossword Cruises drink a lot of whiskey But is that enough What else are you going to put on your back forty I didnt want to think about that not then The next forty years could take care of themselves I would be happy just to get through New Years Day of  When I felt I had myself under control I went back into my study shuffled to the computer with my eyes resolutely on my feet felt around for the right button and turned off the machine You can damage the program shutting down like that without putting it away but under the circumstances I hardly thought it mattered That night I once again dreamed I was walking at twilight on Lane Fortytwo which leads to Sara Laughs once more I wished on the evening star as the loons cried on the lake and once more I sensed something in the woods behind me edging ever closer It seemed my Christmas holiday was over That was a hard cold winter lots of snow and in February a flu epidemic that did for an awful lot of Derrys old folks It took them the way a hard wind will take old trees after an ice storm It missed me completely I hadnt so much as a case of the sniffles that winter In March I flew to Providence and took part in Will Wengs New England Crossword Challenge I placed fourth and won fifty bucks I framed the uncashed check and hung it in the living room Once upon a time most of my framed Certificates of Triumph Jos phrase all the good phrases are Jos phrases it seems to me went up on my office walls but by March of  I wasnt going in there very much When I wanted to play Scrabble against the computer or do a tourneylevel crossword puzzle I used the Powerbook and sat at the kitchen table I remember sitting there one day opening the Powerbooks main menu going down to the crossword puzzles then dropping the cursor two or three items further until it had highlighted my old pal Word Six What swept over me then wasnt frustration or impotent balked fury Id experienced a lot of both since finishing All the Way from the Top but sadness and simple longing Looking at the Word Six icon was suddenly like looking at the pictures of Jo I kept in my wallet Studying those Id sometimes think that I would sell my immortal soul in order have her back again    and on that day in March I thought I would sell my soul to be able to write a story again Go on and try it then a voice whispered Maybe things have changed Except that nothing had changed and I knew it So instead of opening Word Six I moved it across to the trash barrel in the lower righthand corner of the screen and dropped it in Goodbye old pal Weinstock called a lot that winter mostly with good news Early in March she reported that Helens Promise had been picked as one half of the Literary Guilds main selection for August the other half a legal thriller by Steve Martini another veteran of the eighttofifteen segment of the Times bestseller list And my British publisher Debra loved Helen was sure it would be my breakthrough book My British sales had always lagged Promise is sort of a new direction for you Debra said Wouldnt you say I kind of thought it was I confessed and wondered how Debbie respond if I told her my newdirection book had been written a dozen years ago Its got    I dont know    a kind of maturity Thanks Mike I think the connections going You sound muffled Sure I did I was biting down on the side of my hand to keep from howling with laughter Now cautiously I took it out of my mouth and examined the bitemarks Better Yes lots So whats the new one about Give me a hint You know the answer to that one kiddo Debra laughed Youll have to read the book to find out Josephine she said Right Yessum Well keep it coming Your pals at Putnam are crazy about the way youre taking it to the next level I said goodbye I hung up the telephone and then I laughed wildly for about ten minutes Laughed until I was crying Thats me though Always taking it to the next level During this period I also agreed to do a phone interview with a Newsweek writer who was putting together a piece on The New American Gothic whatever that was other than a phrase which might sell a few magazines and to sit for a Publishers Weekly interview which would appear just before publication of Helens Promise I agreed to these because they both sounded softball the sort of interviews you could do over the phone while you read your mail And Debra was delighted because I ordinarily say no to all the publicity I hate that part of the job and always have especially the hell of the live TV chatshow where nobodys ever read your goddam book and the first question is always Where in the world do you get those wacky ideas The publicity process is like going to a sushi bar where youre the sushi and it was great to get past it this time with the feeling that Id been able to give Debra some good news she could take to her bosses Yes she could say hes still being a booger about publicity but I got him to do a couple of things All through this my dreams of Sara Laughs were going on  not every night but every second or third night with me never thinking of them in the daytime I did my crosswords I bought myself an acoustic steel guitar and started learning how to play it I was never going to be invited to tour with Patty Loveless or Alan Jackson however I scanned each days bloated obituaries in the Derry News for names that I knew I was pretty much dozing on my feet in other words What brought all this to an end was a call from Harold Oblowski not more than three days after Debras bookclub call It was storming outside  a vicious snowchangingovertosleet event that proved to be the last and biggest blast of the winter By midevening the power would be off all over Derry but when Harold called at five PM things were just getting cranked up I just had a very good conversation with your editor Harold said A very enlightening very energizing conversation Just got off the in fact Oh Oh indeed Theres a feeling at Putnam Michael that this latest of yours may have a positive effect on your sales position in the market Its very strong Yes I said Im taking it to the next level Huh Im just blabbing Harold Go on Well    Helen Nearings a great lead character and Skate is your best villain ever I said nothing Debra raised the possibility of making Helens Promise the opener of a threebook contract A very lucrative threebook contract All without prompting from me Three is one more than any publisher has wanted to commit to til now I mentioned nine million dollars three per book in other words expecting her to laugh    but an agent has to start somewhere and I always choose the highest ground I can find I think I must have Roman military officers somewhere back in my family tree Ethiopian rugmerchants more like it I thought but didnt say I felt the way you do when the dentist has gone a little heavy on the Novocain and flooded your lips and tongue as well as your bad tooth and the patch of gum surrounding it If I tried to talk Id probably only flap and spread spit Harold was almost purring A threebook contract for the new mature Michael Noonan Tall tickets baby This time I didnt feel like laughing This time I felt like screaming Harold went on happy and oblivious Harold didnt know the bookberrytree had died Harold didnt know the new Mike Noonan had cataclysmic shortness of breath and projectilevomiting fits every time he tried to write You want to hear how she came back to me Michael Lay it on me Well nines obviously high but its as good a place to start as any We feel this new book is a big step forward for him This is extraordinary Extraordinary Now I havent given anything away wanted to talk to you first of course but I think were looking at sevenpointfive minimum In fact   No He paused a moment Long enough for me to realize I was gripping the phone so hard it hurt my hand I had to make a conscious effort to relax my grip Mike if youll just hear me out   I dont need to hear you out I dont want to talk about a new contract Pardon me for disagreeing but therell never be a better time Think about it for Christs sake Were talking top dollar here If you wait until after Helens Promise is published I cant guarantee that the same offer   I know you cant I said I dont want guarantees I dont want offers I dont want to talk contract You dont need to shout Mike I can hear you Had I been shouting Yes I suppose I had been Are you dissatisfied with Putnams I think Debra would be very distressed to hear that I also think Phyllis Grann would do damned near anything to address any concerns you might have Are you sleeping with Debra Harold I thought and all at once it seemed like the most logical idea in the world  that dumpy fiftyish balding little Harold Oblowski was making it with my blonde aristocratic Smitheducated editor Are you sleeping with her do you talk about my future while youre lying in bed together in a room at the Plaza Are the pair of you trying to figure how many golden eggs you can get out of this tired old goose before you finally wring its neck and turn it into pat Is that what youre up to Harold I cant talk about this now and I wont talk about this now Whats wrong Why are you so upset I thought youd be pleased Hell I thought youd be over the fucking moon Theres nothing wrong Its just a bad time for me to talk longterm contract Youll have to pardon me Harold I have something coming out of the oven Can we at least discuss this next w   No I said and hung up I think it was the first time in my adult life Id hung up on someone who wasnt a telephone salesman I had nothing coming out of the oven of course and I was too upset to think about putting something in I went into the living room instead poured myself a short whiskey and sat down in front of the TV I sat there for almost four hours looking at everything and seeing nothing Outside the storm continued cranking up Tomorrow there would be trees down all over Derry and the world would look like an ice sculpture At quarter past nine the power went out came back on for thirty seconds or so then went out and stayed out I took this as a suggestion to stop thinking about Harolds useless contract and how Jo would have chortled the idea of nine million dollars I got up unplugged the blackedout TV so it wouldnt come blaring on at two in the morning I neednt have worried the power was off in Derry for nearly two days and went upstairs I dropped my clothes at the foot of the bed crawled in without even bothering to brush my teeth and was asleep in less than five minutes I dont how long after that it was that the nightmare came It was the last dream I had in what I now think of as my Manderley series the culminating dream It was made even worse I suppose by unrelievable blackness to which I awoke It started like the others Im walking up the lane listening to the crickets and the loons looking mostly at the darkening slot of sky overhead I reach the driveway and here something has changed someone has put a little sticker on the SARA LAUGHS sign I lean closer and see its a radio station sticker WBLM it says  PORTLANDS ROCK AND ROLL BLIMP From the sticker I look back up into the sky and there is Venus I wish her as I always do I wish for Johanna with the dank and vaguely smell of the lake in my nose Something lumbers in the woods rattling old leaves and breaking a branch It sounds big Better get down there a voice in my head tells me Something has taken out a contract on you Michael A threebook contract and thats the worst kind I can never move I can only stand here Ive got walkers block But thats just talk I can walk This time I can walk I am delighted I have had a major breakthrough In the dream I think This changes everything This changes everything Down the driveway I walk deeper and deeper into the clean but sour smell of pine stepping over some of the fallen branches kicking others out of the way I raise my hand to brush the damp hair off my forehead and see the little scratch running across the back of it I stop to look at it curious No time for that the dreamvoice says Get down there Youve got a book to write I cant write I reply That parts over Im on the back forty now No the voice says There is something relentless about it that scares me You had writers walk not writers block and as you can see its gone Now hurry up and get down there Im afraid I tell the voice Afraid of what Well    what if Mrs Danvers is down there The voice doesnt answer It knows Im not afraid of Rebecca de Winters housekeeper shes just a character in an old book nothing but a bag of bones So I begin walking again I have no choice it seems but at every step my terror increases and by the time Im halfway down to the shadowy sprawling bulk of the log house fear has sunk into my bones like fever Something is wrong here something is all twisted up Ill run away I think Ill run back the way I came like the gingerbread man Ill run run all the way back to Derry if thats what it takes and Ill never come here anymore Except I can hear slobbering breath behind me in the growing gloom and padding footsteps The thing in the woods is now the thing in the driveway Its right behind me If I turn around the sight of it will knock the sanity out of my head in a single roundhouse slap Something with red eyes something slumped and hungry The house is my only hope of safety I walk on The crowding bushes clutch like hands In the light of a rising moon the moon has never risen before in this dream but I have never stayed in it this long before the rustling leaves look like sardonic faces I see winking eyes and smiling mouths Below me are the black windows of the house and I know that there will be no power when I get inside the storm has knocked the power out I will flick the lightswitch up and down up and down until something reaches out and takes my wrist and pulls me like a lover deeper into the dark I am three quarters of the way down the driveway now I can see the railroadtie steps leading down to the lake and I can see the float out there on the water a black square in a track of moonlight Bill Dean has put it out I can also see an oblong something lying at the place where driveway ends at the stoop There has never been such an object before What can it be Another two or three steps and I know Its a coffin the one Frank Arlen dickered for    because he said the mortician was trying to stick it to me Its Jos coffin and lying on its side with the top partway open enough for me to see its empty I think I want to scream I think I mean to turn around and run back up the driveway  I will take my chances with the thing behind me But before I can the back door of Sara Laughs opens and a terrible figure darting out into the growing darkness It is human this figure and yet its not It is a crumpled white thing with baggy arms upraised There is no face where its face should be and yet it is shrieking in a glottal loonlike voice It must be Johanna She was able to escape her coffin her winding shroud She is all tangled up in it How hideously speedy this creature is It doesnt drift as one imagines ghosts drifting but races across the stoop toward the driveway It has been waiting down here during all the dreams when I had been frozen and now that I have finally been able to walk down it means to have me Ill scream when it wraps me in its silk arms and I will scream when I smell its rotting bugraddled flesh and see its dark staring eyes through the fine weave of the cloth I will scream as the sanity leaves my mind forever I will scream    but there is no one out here to hear me Only the loons will hear me I have come again to Manderley and this time I will never leave The shrieking white thing reached for me and I woke up on the floor of crying out in a cracked horrified voice and slamming my head repeatedly against something How long before I finally realized I was no longer asleep that I wasnt at Sara Laughs How long before I realized that I had fallen out of bed at some point and had crawled across the room in my sleep that I was on my hands and knees in a corner butting my head against the place where the walls came together doing it over and over again like a lunatic in an asylum I didnt know couldnt with the power out and the bedside clock dead I know that at first I couldnt move out of the corner because it felt safer than the wider room would have done and I know that for a long time the dreams force held me even after I woke up mostly I imagine because I couldnt turn on a light and dispel its power I was afraid that if I crawled out of my corner the white thing would burst out of my bathroom shrieking its dead shriek eager to finish what it had started I know I was shivering all over and that I was cold and wet from the waist down because my bladder had let go I stayed there in the corner gasping and wet staring into the darkness wondering if you could have a nightmare powerful enough in its imagery to drive you insane I thought then and think now that I almost found out on that night in March Finally I felt able to leave the corner Halfway across the floor I pulled off my wet pajama pants and when I did that I got disoriented What followed was a miserable and surreal five minutes in which I crawled aimlessly back and forth in my familiar bedroom bumping into stuff and moaning each time I hit something with a blind flailing hand Each thing I touched at first seemed like that awful white thing Nothing I touched felt like anything I knew With the reassuring green numerals of the bedside clock gone and my sense of direction temporarily lost I could have been crawling around a mosque in Addis Ababa At last I ran shoulderfirst into the bed I stood up yanked the pillowcase off the extra pillow and wiped my groin and upper legs with it Then I crawled back into bed pulled the blankets up and lay there shivering listening to the steady tick of sleet on the windows There was no sleep for me the rest of that night and the dream didnt fade as dreams usually do upon waking I lay on my side the shivers slowly subsiding thinking of her coffin there in the driveway thinking that it made a kind of mad sense  Jo had loved Sara and if she were haunt anyplace it would be there But why would she want to hurt me Why would my Jo ever want to hurt me I could think of no reason Somehow the time passed and there came a moment when I realized the air had turned a dark shade of gray the shapes of the furniture in it like sentinels in fog That was a little better That was more it I would light the kitchen woodstove I decided and make strong coffee Begin the work of getting this behind me I swung my legs out of bed and raised my hand to brush my sweathair off my forehead I froze with the hand in front of my eyes I must have scraped it while I was crawling disoriented in the dark and to find my way back to bed There was a shallow clotted cut across the back just below the knuckles Once when I was sixteen a plane went supersonic directly over my head I was walking in the woods when it happened thinking of some story I was going to write perhaps or how great it would be if Doreen Fournier weakened some Friday night and let me take off her panties while we were parked at the end of Cushman Road In any case I was travelling far roads in my own mind and when that boom went off I was caught totally by surprise I went flat on the leafy ground with my hands over my head and my heart drumming crazily sure Id reached the end of my life and while I was still a virgin In my forty years that was the only thing which equalled the final dream of the Manderley series for utter terror I lay on the ground waiting for the hammer to fall and when thirty seconds or so passed and no hammer did fall I began to realize it had just been some jetjockey from the Brunswick Naval Air Station too eager to wait until he was out over the Atlantic before going to Mach But holy shit who ever could have guessed that it would be so loud I got slowly to my feet and as I stood there with my heart finally slowing down I realized I wasnt the only thing that had been scared witless by that sudden clearsky boom For the first time in my memory the little patch of woods behind our house in Prouts Neck was entirely silent I stood there in a dusty bar of sunlight crumbled leaves all over my teeshirt and jeans holding my breath listening I had never heard a silence like it Even on a cold day in January the woods would have been full of conversation At last a finch sang There were two or three seconds of silence and then a jay replied Another two or three seconds went by and then a crow added his two cents worth A woodpecker began to hammer for grubs A chipmunk bumbled through some underbrush on my left A minute after I had stood up the woods were fully alive with little noises again it was back to business as usual and I continued with my own I never forgot that unexpected boom though or the deathly silence which followed it I thought of that June day often in the wake of the nightmare and there was nothing so remarkable in that Things had changed somehow or could change    but first comes silence while we assure ourselves that we are still unhurt and that the danger  if there was danger  is gone Derry was shut down for most of the following week anyway Ice and high winds caused a great deal of damage during the storm and a sudden twentydegree plunge in the temperature afterward made the digging out hard and the cleanup slow Added to that the atmosphere after a March storm is always dour and pessimistic we get them up this way every year and two or three in April for good measure if were not lucky but we never seem to expect them Every time we get clouted we take it personally On a day toward the end of that week the weather finally started to break I took advantage going out for a cup of coffee and a midmorning pastry at the little restaurant three doors down from the Rite Aid where Johanna did her last errand I was sipping and chewing and working the newspaper crossword when someone asked Could I share your booth Mr Noonan Its pretty crowded in here today I looked up and saw an old man that I knew but couldnt quite place Ralph Roberts he said I volunteer down at the Red Cross Me and my wife Lois Oh okay sure I said I give blood at the Red Cross every six weeks or so Ralph Roberts was one of the old parties who passed out juice and cookies afterward telling you not to get up or make any sudden movements if you felt woozy Please sit down He looked at my paper folded open to the crossword and lying in a patch of sun as he slid into the booth Dont you find that doing the crossword in the Derry News is sort of like striking out the pitcher in a baseball game he asked I laughed and nodded I do it for the same reason folks climb Mount Everest Mr Roberts    because its there Only with the News crossword no one ever falls off Call me Ralph Please Okay And Im Mike Good He grinned revealing teeth that were crooked and a little yellow but all his own I like getting to the first names Its like being able to take off your tie Was quite a little cap of wind we had wasnt it Yes I said but its warming up nicely now The thermometer had made one of its nimble March leaps climbing from twentyfive degrees the night before to fifty that morning Better than the rise in airtemperature the sun was warm again on your face It was that warmth that had coaxed me out of the house Springll get here I guess Some years it gets a little lost but it always seems to find its way back home He sipped his coffee then set the cup down Havent seen you at the Red Cross lately Im recycling I said but that was a fib Id come eligible to give another pint two weeks ago The reminder card was up on the refrigerator It had just slipped my mind Next week for sure I only mention it because I know youre an A and we can always use that Save me a couch Count on it Everything going all right I only ask because you look tired If its insomnia I can sympathize believe me He did have the look of an insomniac I thought  too wide around the eyes somehow But he was also a man in his mid to late seventies and I dont think anyone gets that far without showing it Stick around a little while and life maybe only jabs at your cheeks and eyes Stick around a long while and you end up looking like Jake La Motta after a hard fifteen I opened my mouth to say what I always do when someone asks me if Im all right then wondered why I always felt I had to pull that tiresome Marlboro Man shit just who I was trying to fool What did I think would happen if I told the guy who gave me a chocolatechip cookie down at the Red Cross after the nurse took the needle out of my arm that I wasnt feeling a hundred percent Earthquakes Fire and flood Shit No I said I really havent been feeling so great Ralph Flu Its been going around Nah The flu missed me this time actually And Ive been sleeping all right Which was true  there had been no recurrence of the Sara Laughs dream in either the normal or the highoctane version I think Ive just got the blues Well you ought to take a vacation he said then sipped his coffee When he looked up at me again he frowned and set his cup down What Is something wrong No I thought of saying You were just the first bird to sing into the silence Ralph thats all No nothing wrong I said and then because I sort of wanted to see how the words tasted coming out of my own mouth I repeated them A vacation Ayuh he said smiling People do it all the time People do it all the time He was right about that even people who couldnt strictly afford to went on vacation When they got tired When they got all balled up in their own shit When the world was too much with them getting and spending I could certainly afford a vacation and I could certainly take the time off from work  what work haha  and yet Id needed the Red Cross cookieman to point out what should have been selfevident to a collegeeducated guy like me that I hadnt been on an actual vacation since Jo and I had gone to Bermuda the winter before she died My particular grindstone was no longer turning but I had kept my nose to it all the same It wasnt until that summer when I read Ralph Robertss obituary in the News he was struck by a car that I fully realized how much I owed him That advice was better than any glass of orange juice I ever got after giving blood let me tell you When I left the restaurant I didnt go home but tramped over half of the damned town the section of newspaper with the partly completed crossword puzzle in it clamped under one arm I walked until I was chilled in spite of the warming temperatures I didnt think about anything and yet I thought about everything It was a special kind of thinking the sort Id always done when I was getting close to writing a book and although I hadnt thought that way in years I fell into it easily and naturally as if I had never been away Its like some guys with a big truck have pulled up in your driveway and are moving things into your basement I cant explain it any better than that You cant see what these things are because theyre all wrapped up in padded quilts but you dont need to see them Its furniture everything you need to make your house a home make it just right just the way you wanted it When the guys have hopped back into their truck and driven away you go down to the basement and walk around the way I went walking around Derry that late morning slopping up hill and down dale in my old galoshes touching a padded curve here a padded angle there Is this one a sofa Is that one a dresser It doesnt matter Everything is here the movers didnt forget a thing and although youll have to get it all upstairs yourself straining your poor old back in the process more often than not thats okay The important thing is that the delivery was complete This time I thought  hoped  the delivery truck had brought the stuff I needed for the back forty the years I might have to spend in a No Writing Zone To the cellar door they had come and they had knocked politely and when after several months there was still no answer they had finally fetched a battering ram HEY BUDDY HOPE THE NOISE DIDNT SCARE YOU TOO BAD SORRY ABOUT THE DOOR I didnt care about the door I cared about the furniture Any pieces broken or missing I didnt think so I thought all I had to do was get it upstairs pull off the furniture pads and put it where it belonged On my way back home I passed The Shade Derrys charming little revival movie house which has prospered in spite of or perhaps because of the video revolution This month they were showing classic SF from the fifties but April was dedicated to Humphrey Bogart Jos alltime favorite I stood under the marquee for several moments studying one of the Coming Attractions posters Then I went home picked a travel agent pretty much at random from the phone book and told the guy I wanted to go to Key Largo Key West you mean the guy said No I told him I mean Key Largo just like in the movie with Bogie and Bacall Three weeks Then I rethought that I was wealthy I was on my own and I was retired What was this three weeks shit Make it six I said Find me a cottage or something Going to be expensive he said I told him I didnt care When I came back to Derry it would be spring In the meantime I had some furniture to unwrap I was enchanted with Key Largo for the first month and bored out of my mind for the last two weeks I stayed though because boredom is good People with a high tolerance for boredom can get a lot of thinking done I ate about a billion shrimp drank about a thousand margaritas and read twentythree John D MacDonald novels by actual count I burned peeled and finally tanned I bought a longbilled cap with PARROTHEAD printed on it in bright green thread I walked the same stretch of beach until I knew everybody by first name And I unwrapped furniture A lot of it I didnt like but there was no doubt that it all fit the house I thought about Jo and our life together I thought about saying to her that no one was ever going to confuse Being Two with Look Homeward Angel You arent going to pull a lot of frustratedartist crap on me are you Noonan she had replied    and during my time on Key Largo those words kept coming back always in Jos voice crap frustratedartist crap all that fucking schoolboy frustratedartist crap I thought about her long red woods apron coming to me with a hatful of black trumpet mushrooms laughing and triumphant Nobody on the TR eats better than the Noonans tonight shed cried I thought of her painting her toenails bent over between her own thighs in the way only women doing that particular piece of business can manage I thought of her throwing a book at me because I laughed at some new haircut I thought of her trying to learn how to play a breakdown on her banjo and of how she looked braless in a thin sweater I thought of her crying and laughing and angry I thought of her telling me it was crap all that frustratedartist crap And I thought about the dreams especially the culminating dream I could do that easily because it never faded as the more ordinary ones do The final Sara Laughs dream and my very first wet dream coming upon a girl lying naked in a hammock and eating a plum are the only two that remain perfectly clear to me year after year the rest are either hazy fragments or completely forgotten There were a great many clear details to the Sara dreams  the loons the crickets the evening star and my wish upon it just to name a few  but I thought most of those things were just verisimilitude Scenesetting if you will As such they could be dismissed from my considerations That left three major elements three large pieces of furniture to be unwrapped As I sat on the beach watching the sun go down between my sandy toes I didnt think you had to be a shrink to see how those three things went together In the Sara dreams the major elements were the woods behind me the house below me and Michael Noonan himself frozen in the middle Its getting dark and theres danger in the woods It will be frightening to go to the house below perhaps because its been empty so long but I never doubt I must go there scary or not its the only shelter I have Except I cant do it I cant move Ive got writers walk In the nightmare I am finally able to go toward shelter only the shelter proves false Proves more dangerous than I had ever expected in my    well yes in my wildest dreams My dead wife rushes out screaming and still tangled in her shroud to attack me Even five weeks later and almost three thousand miles from Derry remembering that speedy white thing with its baggy arms would make me shiver and look back over my shoulder But was it Johanna I didnt really know did I The thing was all wrapped up The coffin looked like the one in which she had been buried true but that might just be misdirection Writers walk writers block I cant write I told the voice in the dream The voice says I can The voice says the writers block is gone and I believe it because the writers walk is gone Im finally headed down the driveway going to shelter Im afraid though Even before the shapeless white thing makes its appearance Im terrified I say its Mrs Danvers Im afraid of but thats just my dreaming mind getting Sara Laughs and Manderley all mixed up Im afraid of  Im afraid of writing I heard myself saying out loud Im afraid to even try This was the night before I finally flew back to Maine and I was halfpast sober going on drunk By the end of my vacation I was drinking a lot of evenings Its not the block that scares me its undoing the block Im really fucked boys and girls Im fucked bigtime Fucked or not I had an idea Id finally reached the heart of the matter I was afraid of undoing the block maybe afraid of picking up the strands of my life and going on without Jo Yet some deep part of my mind believed I must do it thats what the menacing noises behind me in the woods were about And belief counts for a lot Too much maybe especially if youre imaginative When an imaginative person gets into mental trouble the line between seeming and being has a way of disappearing Things in the woods yes sir I had one of them right there in my hand as I was thinking these things I lifted my drink holding it toward the western sky so that the setting sun seemed to be burning in the glass I was drinking a lot and maybe that was okay on Key Largo  hell people were supposed to drink a lot on vacation it was almost the law  but Id been drinking too much even before I left The kind of drinking that could get out of hand in no time at all The kind that could get a man in trouble Things in the woods and the potentially safe place guarded by a scary bugbear that was not my wife but perhaps my wifes memory It made sense because Sara Laughs had always been Jos favorite place on earth That thought led to another one that made me swing my legs over the side of the chaise Id been reclining on and sit up in excitement Sara Laughs had also been the place where the ritual had begun    champagne last line and the allimportant benediction Well then thats all right isnt it Did I want things to be all right again Did I truly want that A month or a year before I mightnt have been sure but now I was The answer was yes I wanted to move on  let go of my dead wife rehab my heart move on But to do that Id have to go back Back to the log house Back to Sara Laughs Yeah I said and my body broke out in gooseflesh Yeah you got it So why not The question made me feel as stupid as Ralph Robertss observation that I needed a vacation If I needed to go back to Sara Laughs now that my vacation was over indeed why not It might be a little scary the first night or two a hangover from my final dream but just being there might dissolve the dream faster And this last thought I allowed in only one humble corner of my conscious mind something might happen with my writing It wasnt likely    but it wasnt impossible either Barring a miracle hadnt that been my thought on New Years Day as I sat on the rim of the tub holding a damp washcloth to the cut on my forehead Yes Barring a miracle Sometimes blind people fall down knock their heads and regain their sight Sometimes maybe cripples are able to throw their crutches away when they get to the top of the church steps I had eight or nine months before Harold and Debra started really bugging me for the next novel I decided to spend the time at Sara Laughs It would take me a little while to tie things up in Derry and awhile for Bill Dean to get the house on the lake ready for a yearround resident but I could be down there by the Fourth of July easily I decided that was a good date to shoot for not just the birthday of our country but pretty much the end of bug season in western Maine By the day I packed up my vacation gear the John D MacDonald paperbacks I left for the cabins next inhabitant shaved a weeks worth of stubble off a face so tanned it no longer looked like my own to me and flew back to Maine I was decided Id go back to the place my subconscious mind had identified as shelter against the deepening dark Id go back even though my mind had also suggested that doing so would not be without risks I would not go back expecting Sara to be Lourdes    but I would allow myself to hope and when I saw the evening star peeping out over the lake for the first time I would allow myself to wish on it Only one thing didnt fit into my neat deconstruction of the Sara dreams and because I couldnt explain it I tried to ignore it I didnt have much luck though part of me was still a writer I guess and a writer is a man who has taught his mind to misbehave It was the cut on the back of my hand That cut had been in all the dreams I would swear it had    and then it had actually appeared You didnt get that sort of shit in the works of Dr Freud stuff like that was strictly for the Psychic Friends hotline It was a coincidence thats all I thought as my plane started its descent I was in seat A the nice thing about flying up front is that if the plane goes down youre first to the crash site and looking at pine forests as we slipped along the glidepath toward Bangor International Airport The snow was gone for another year I had vacationed it to death Only coincidence How many times have you cut your hands I mean theyre always out front arent they waving themselves around Practically begging for it All that should have rung true and yet somehow it didnt quite It should have but    well    It was the boys in the basement They were the ones who didnt buy it The boys in the basement didnt buy it at all At that point there was a thump as the  touched down and I put the whole line of thought out of my mind One afternoon shortly after arriving back home I rummaged the closets until I found the shoeboxes containing Jos old photographs I sorted them then studied my way through the ones of Dark Score Lake There were a staggering number of these but because Johanna was the shutterbug there werent many with her in them I found one though that I remembered taking in  or  Sometimes even an untalented photographer can take a good picture   if seven hundred monkeys spent seven hundred years bashing away at seven hundred typewriters and all that  and this was good In it Jo was standing on the float with the sun going down redgold behind her She was just out of the water dripping wet wearing a twopiece swimming suit gray with red piping I had caught her laughing and brushing her soaked hair back from her forehead and temples Her nipples were very prominent against the cups of her halter She looked like an actress on a movie poster for one of those guiltypleasure Bpictures about monsters at Party Beach or a serial killer stalking the campus I was suckerpunched by a sudden powerful lust for her I wanted her upstairs just as she was in that photograph with strands of her hair pasted to her cheeks and that wet bathing suit clinging to her I wanted to suck her nipples through the halter top taste the cloth and feel their hardness through it I wanted to suck water out of the cotton like milk then yank the bottom of her suit off and fuck her until we both exploded Hands shaking a little I put the photograph aside with some others I liked although there were no others I liked in quite that same way I had a huge hardon one of those ones that feel like stone covered with skin Get one of those and until it goes away you are good for nothing The quickest way to solve a problem like that when theres no woman around willing to help you solve it is to masturbate but that time the idea never even crossed my mind Instead I walked restlessly through the upstairs rooms of my house with my fists opening and closing and what looked like a hood ornament stuffed down the front of my jeans Anger may be a normal stage of the grieving process  Ive read that it is  but I was never angry at Johanna in the wake of her death until the day I found that picture Then wow There I was walking around with a boner that just wouldnt quit furious with her Stupid bitch why had she been running on one of the hottest days of the year Stupid inconsiderate bitch to leave me alone like this not even able to work I sat down on the stairs and wondered what I should do A drink was what I should do I decided and then maybe another drink to scratch the first ones back I actually got up before deciding that wasnt a very good idea at all I went into my office instead turned on the computer and did a crossword puzzle That night when I went to bed I thought of looking at the picture of Jo in her bathing suit again I decided that was almost as bad an idea as a few drinks when I was feeling angry and depressed But Ill have the dream tonight I thought as I turned off the light Ill have the dream for sure I didnt though My dreams of Sara Laughs seemed to be finished A weeks thought made the idea of at least summering at the lake seem better than ever So on a Saturday afternoon in early May when I calculated that any selfrespecting Maine caretaker would be home watching the Red Sox I called Bill Dean and told him Id be at my lake place from the Fourth of July or so    and that if things went as I hoped Id be spending the fall and winter there as well Well thats good he said Thats real good news A lot of folks down hereve missed you Mike Quite a few that want to condole with you about your wife dont you know Was there the faintest note of reproach in his voice or was that just my imagination Certainly Jo and I had cast a shadow in the area we had made significant contributions to the little library which served the MottonKashwakamakCastle View area and Jo had headed the successful fund drive to get an area bookmobile up and running In addition to that she had been part of a ladies sewing circle afghans were her specialty and a member in good standing of the Castle County Crafts Coop Visits to the sick    helping out with the annual volunteer fire department blood drive    womaning a booth during Summerfest in Castle Rock    and stuff like that was only where she had started She didnt do it in any ostentatious Lady Bountiful way either but unobtrusively and humbly with her head lowered often to hide a rather sharp smile I should add  my Jo had a Biercean sense of humor Christ I thought maybe old Bill had a right to sound reproachful People miss her I said Ayuh they do I still miss her a lot myself I think thats why Ive stayed away from the lake Thats where a lot of our good times were I spose so But itll be damned good to see you down this way Ill get busy The place is all right  you could move into it this afternoon if you was a mind  but when a house has stood empty the way Sara has it gets stale I know Ill get Brenda Meserve to clean the whole shebang from top to bottom Same gal you always had dont you know Brendas a little old for comprehensive spring cleaning isnt she The lady in question was about sixtyfive stout kind and gleefully vulgar She was especially fond of jokes about the travelling salesman who spent the night like a rabbit jumping from hole to hole No Mrs Danvers she Ladies like Brenda Meserve never get too old to oversee the festivities Bill said Shell get two or three girls to do the vacuuming and heavy lifting Set you back maybe three hundred dollars Sound all right Like a bargain The well needs to be tested and the gennie too although Im sure both of ems okay I seen a hornets nest by Jos old studio that I want to smoke before the woods get dry Oh and the roof of the old house  you know the middle piece  needs to be reshingled I shoulda talked to you about that last year but with you not using the place I let her slide You stand good for that too Yes up to ten grand Beyond that call me If we have to go over ten Ill smile and kiss a pig Try to have it all done before I get down there okay Coss Youll want your privacy I know that    just so longs you know you wont get any right away We was shocked when she went so young all of us were Shocked and sad She was a dear From a Yankee mouth that word rhymes with Leah Thank you Bill I felt tears prickle my eyes Grief is like a drunken house guest always coming back for one more goodbye hug Thanks for saying Youll get your share of carrotcakes chummy He laughed but a little doubtfully as if afraid he was committing an impropriety I can eat a lot of carrotcake I said and if folks overdo it well hasnt Kenny Auster still got that big Irish wolfhound Yuh that thingd eat cake til he busted Bill cried in high good humor He cackled until he was coughing I waited smiling a little myself Blueberry he calls that dog damned if I know why Aint he the gormiest thing I assumed he meant the dog and not the dogs master Kenny Auster not much more than five feet tall and neatly made was the opposite of gormy that peculiar Maine adjective that means clumsy awkward and clayfooted I suddenly realized that I missed these people  Bill and Brenda and Buddy Jellison and Kenny Auster and all the others who lived yearround at the lake I even missed Blueberry the Irish wolfhound who trotted everywhere with his head up just as if he had half a brain in it and long strands of saliva depending from his jaws Ive also got to get down there and clean up the winter blowdown Bill said He sounded embarrassed It aint bad this year  that last big storm was all snow over our way thank God  but theres still a fair amount of happy crappy I aint got to yet I shoulda put it behind me long before now You not using the place aint an excuse I been cashing your checks There was something amusing about listening to the grizzled old fart beating his breast Jo would have kicked her feet and giggled Im quite sure If everythings right and running by July Fourth Bill Ill be happy Youll be happy as a clam in a mudflat then Thats a promise Bill sounded as happy as a clam in a mudflat himself and I was glad Goingter come down and write a book by the water Like in the old days Not that the last couple aint been fine my wife couldnt put that last one down but   I dont know I said which was the truth And then an idea struck me Bill would you do me a favor before you clean up the driveway and turn Brenda Meserve loose Happy to if I can he said so I told him what I wanted Four days later I got a little package with this laconic return address DEANGEN DELIVTR DARK SCORE I opened it and shook out twenty photographs which had been taken with one of those little cameras you use once and then throw away Bill had filled out the roll with various views of the house most conveying that subtle air of neglect a place gets when its not used enough    even a place thats caretook to use Bills word gets that neglected feel after awhile I barely glanced at these The first four were the ones I wanted and I lined them up on the kitchen table where the strong sunlight would fall directly on them Bill had taken these from the top of the driveway pointing the disposable camera down at the sprawl of Sara Laughs I could see the moss which had grown not only on south wings as well I could see the litter of fallen branches and the drifts of pine needles on the driveway Bill must have been tempted to clear all that away before taking his snaps but he hadnt Id told him exactly what I wanted  warts and all was the phrase I had used  and Bill had given it to me The bushes on either side of the driveway had thickened a lot since Jo and I had spent any significant amount of time at the lake they hadnt exactly run wild but yes some of the longer branches did seem to yearn toward each other across the asphalt like separated lovers Yet what my eye came back to again and again was the stoop at the foot of the driveway The other resemblances between the photographs and my dreams of Sara Laughs might only be coincidental or the writers often surprisingly practical imagination at work but I could explain the sunflowers growing out through the boards of the stoop no more than I had been able to explain the cut on the back of my hand I turned one of the photos over On the back in a spidery script Bill had written These fellows are way early    and trespassing I flipped back to the picture side Three sunflowers growing up through the boards of the stoop Not two not four but three large sunflowers with faces like searchlights Just like the ones in my dream On July rd of I threw two suitcases and my Powerbook in the trunk of my midsized Chevrolet started to back down the driveway then stopped and went into the house again It felt empty and somehow forlorn like a faithful lover who has been dropped and cannot understand why The furniture wasnt covered and the power was still on I understood that The Great Lake Experiment might turn out to be a swift and total failure but  Benton Street felt deserted all the same Rooms too full of furniture to echo still did when I walked through them and everywhere there seemed to be too much dusty light In my study the VDT was hooded like an executioner against the dust I knelt before it and opened one of the desk drawers Inside were four reams of paper I took one started away with it under my arm then had a second thought and turned back I had put that provocative photo of Jo in her swimsuit in the wide center drawer Now I took it tore the paper wrapping from the end of the ream of paper and slid the photo halfway in like a bookmark If I did perchance begin to write again and if the writing marched I would meet Johanna right around page two hundred and fifty I left the house locked the back door got into my car and drove away I have never been back Id been tempted to go down to the lake and check out the work  which turned out to be quite a bit more extensive than Bill Dean had originally expected  on several occasions What kept me away was a feeling never quite articulated by my conscious mind but still very powerful that I wasnt supposed to do it that way that when I next came to Sara it should be to unpack and stay Bill hired out Kenny Auster to shingle the roof and got Kennys cousin Timmy Larribee to scrape the old girl down a cleansing process akin to potscrubbing that is sometimes employed with log homes Bill also had a plumber in to check out the pipes and got my okay to replace some of the older plumbing and the wellpump Bill fussed about all these expenses over the telephone I let him When it comes to fifth or sixthgeneration Yankees and the expenditure of money you might as well just stand back and let them get it out of their systems Laying out the green just seems wrong to a Yankee somehow like petting in public As for myself I didnt mind the outgo a bit I live frugally for the most part not out of any moral code but because my imagination very lively in most other respects doesnt work very well on the subject of money My idea of a spree is three days in Boston a Red Sox game a trip to Tower Records and Video plus a visit to the Wordsworth bookstore in Cambridge Living like that doesnt make much of a dent in the interest let alone the principal I had a good money manager down in Waterville and on the day I locked the door of the Derry house and headed west to TR I was worth slightly over five million dollars Not much compared to Bill Gates but big numbers for this area and I could afford to be cheerful about the high cost of house repairs That was a strange late spring and early summer for me What I did mostly was wait close up my town affairs talk to Bill Dean when he called with the latest round of problems and try not to think I did the Publishers Weekly interview and when the interviewer asked me if Id had any trouble getting back to work in the wake of my bereavement I said no with an absolutely straight face Why not It was true My troubles hadnt started until Id finished All the Way from the Top until then I had been going on like gangbusters In midJune I met Frank Arlen for lunch at the Starlite Cafe The Starlite is in Lewiston which is the geographical midpoint between his town and mine Over dessert the Starlites famous strawberry shortcake Frank asked if I was seeing anyone I looked at him with surprise What are you gaping at he asked his face registering one of the nine hundred unnamed emotions  this one of those somewhere between amusement and irritation I certainly wouldnt think of it as twotiming Jo Shell have been dead four years come August No I said Im not seeing anybody He looked at me silently I looked back for a few seconds then started fiddling my spoon through the whipped cream on top of my shortcake The biscuits were still warm from the oven and the cream was melting It made me think of that silly old song about how someone left the cake out in the rain Have you seen anybody Mike Im not sure thats any business of yours Oh for Christs sake On your vacation Did you   I made myself look up from the melting whipped cream No I said I did not He was silent for another moment or two I thought he was getting ready to move on to another topic That would have been fine with me Instead he came right out and asked me if I had been laid at all since Johanna died He would have accepted a lie on that subject even if he didnt entirely believe it  men lie about sex all the time But I told the truth    and with a certain perverse pleasure No Not a single time Not a single time What about a massage parlor You know to at least get a   No He sat there tapping his spoon against the rim of the bowl with his dessert in it He hadnt taken a single bite He was looking at me as though I were some new and oogy specimen of bug I didnt like it much but I suppose I understood it I had been close to what is these days called a relationship on two occasions neither of them on Key Largo where I had observed roughly two thousand pretty women walking around dressed in only a stitch and a promise Once it had been a redhaired waitress Kelli at a restaurant out on the Extension where I often had lunch After awhile we got talking joking around and then there started to be some of that eyecontact you know the kind Im talking about looks that go on just a little too long I started to notice her legs and the way her uniform pulled against her hip when she turned and she noticed me noticing And there was a woman at Nu You the place where I used to work out A tall woman who favored pink jogbras and black bike shorts Quite yummy Also I liked the stuff she brought to read while she pedalled one of the stationary bikes on those endless aerobic trips to nowhere  not Mademoiselle or Cosmo but novels by people like John Irving and Ellen Gilchrist I like people who read actual books and not just because I once wrote them myself Bookreaders are just as willing as anyone else to start out with the weather but as a general rule they can actually go on from there The name of the blonde in the pink tops and black shorts was Adria Bundy We started talking about books as we pedalled side by side ever deeper into nowhere and there came a point where I was spotting her one or two mornings a week in the weight room Theres something oddly intimate about spotting The prone position of the lifter is part of it I suppose especially when the lifter is a woman but not all or even most of it Mostly its the dependence factor Although it hardly ever comes to that point the lifter is trusting the spotter with his or her life And at some point in the winter of  those looks started as she lay on the bench and I stood over her looking into her upsidedown face The ones that go on just a little too long Kelli was around thirty Adria perhaps a little younger Kelli was divorced Adria never married In neither case would I have been robbing the cradle and I think either would have been happy to go to bed with me on a provisional basis Kind of a honeybump testdrive Yet what I did in Kellis case was to find a different restaurant to eat my lunch at and when the YMCA sent me a free exercisetryout offer I took them up on it and just never went back to Nu You I remember walking past Adria Bundy one day on the street six months or so after I made the change and although I said hi I made sure not to see her puzzled slightly hurt gaze In a purely physical way I wanted them both in fact I seem to remember a dream in which I had them both in the same bed and at the same time and yet I wanted neither Part of it was my inability to write  my life was quite fucked up enough thank you without adding any additional complications Part of it was the work involved in making sure that the woman who is returning your glances is interested in you and not your rather extravagant bank account Most of it I think was that there was just too much Jo still in my head and heart There was no room for anyone else even after four years It was sorrow like cholesterol and if you think thats funny or weird be grateful What about friends Frank asked at last beginning to eat his strawberry shortcake Youve got friends you see dont you Yes I said Plenty of friends Which was a lie but I did have lots of crosswords to do lots of books to read and lots of movies to watch on my VCR at night I could practically recite the FBI warning about unlawful copying by heart When it came to real live people the only ones I called when I got ready to leave Derry were my doctor and my dentist and most of the mail I sent out that June consisted of changeof address cards to magazines like Harpers and National Geographic Frank I said you sound like a Jewish mother Sometimes when Im with you feel like a Jewish mother he said One who believes in the curative powers of baked potatoes instead of matzo balls You look better than you have in a long time finally put on some weight I think   Too much Bullshit you looked like Ichabod Crane when you came for Christmas Also youve got some sun on your face and arms Ive been walking a lot So you look better    except for your eyes Sometimes you get this look in your eyes and I worry about you every time I see it I think Jo would be glad someones worrying What look is that I asked Your basic thousandyard stare Want the truth You look like someone whos caught on something and cant get loose I left Derry at threethirty stopped in Rumford for supper then drove slowly on through the rising hills of western Maine as the sun lowered I had planned my times of departure and arrival carefully if not quite consciously and as I passed out of Motton and into the unincorporated township of TR I became aware of the heavy way my heart was beating There was sweat on my face and arms in spite of the cars air conditioning Nothing on the radio sounded right all the music like screaming and I turned it off I was scared and had good reason to be Even setting aside the peculiar crosspollination between the dreams and things in the real world as I was able to do quite easily dismissing the cut on my hand and the sunflowers growing through the boards of the back stoop as either coincidence or so much psychic fluff I had reason to be scared Because they hadnt been ordinary dreams and my decision to go back to the lake after all this time hadnt been an ordinary decision I didnt feel like a modern findemillnaire man on a spiritual quest to face his fears Im okay youre okay lets all have an emotional circlejerk while William Ackerman plays softly in the background I felt more like some crazy Old Testament prophet going out into the desert to live on locusts and alkali water because God had summoned him in a dream I was in trouble my life was a moderategoingonsevere mess and not being able to write was only part of it I wasnt raping kids or running around Times Square preaching conspiracy theories through a bullhorn but I was in trouble just the same I had lost my place in things and couldnt find it again No surprise there after all lifes not a book What I was engaging in on that hot July evening was selfinduced shock therapy and give me at least this much credit  I knew it You come to Dark Score this way  from Derry to Newport Route  from Newport to Bethel with a stop in Rumford which used to stink like hells front porch until the paperdriven economy pretty much ground to a halt during Reagans second term Route  from Bethel to Waterford Then you take Route  the old County Road across Castle View through Motton where downtown consists of a converted barn which sells videos beer and secondhand rifles and then past the sign which reads TR and the one reading GAME WARDEN IS BEST ASSISTANCE IN EMERGENCY DIAL GAME OR   ON CELLULAR PHONE To this in spray paint someone has added FUCK THE EAGLES Five miles past that sign you come to a narrow lane on the right marked only by a square of tin with the faded number  on it Above this like umlauts are a couple of  holes I turned into this lane just about when I had expected to  it was  PM EDT by the clock on the Chevrolets dashboard And the feeling was coming home I drove in two tenths of a mile by the odometer listening to the grass which crowned the lane whickering against the undercarriage of my car listening to the occasional branch which scraped across the roof or knocked on the passenger side like a fist At last I parked and turned the engine off I got out walked to the rear of the car lay down on my belly and began pulling all of the grass which touched the Chevys hot exhaust system It had been a dry summer and it was best to take precautions I had come at this exact hour in order to replicate my dreams hoping for some further insight into them or for an idea of what to do next What I had not come to do was start a forest fire Once this was done I stood up and looked around The crickets sang as they had in my dreams and the trees huddled close on either side of the lane as they always did in my dreams Overhead the sky was a fading strip of blue I set off walking up the right hand wheelrut Jo and I had had one neighbor at this end of the road old Lars Washburn but now Larss driveway was overgrown with juniper bushes and blocked by a rusty length of chain Nailed to a tree on the left of the chain was NO TRESPASSING Nailed to one on the right was NEXT CENTURY REAL ESTATE and a local number The words were faded and hard to read in the growing gloom I walked on once more conscious of my heavily beating heart and of the way the mosquitoes were buzzing around my face and arms Their peak season was past but I was sweating a lot and thats a smell they like It must remind them of blood Just how scared was I as I approached Sara Laughs I dont remember I suspect that fright like pain is one of those things that slip our minds once they have passed What I do remember is a feeling Id had before when I was down here especially when I was walking this road by myself It was a sense that reality was thin I think it is thin you know thin as lake ice after a thaw and we fill our lives with noise and light and motion to hide that thinness from ourselves But in places like Lane Fortytwo you find that all the smoke and mirrors have been removed Whats left is the sound of crickets and the sight of green leaves darkening toward black branches that make shapes like faces the sound of your heart in your chest the beat of the blood against the backs of your eyes and the look of the sky as the days blue blood runs out of its cheek What comes in when daylight leaves is a kind of certainty that beneath the skin there is a secret some mystery both black and bright You feel this mystery in every breath you see it in every shadow you expect to plunge into it at every turn of a step It is here you slip across it on a kind of breathless curve like a skater turning for home I stopped for a moment about half a mile south of where Id left the car and still half a mile north of the driveway Here the road curves sharply and on the right is an open field which slants steeply down toward the lake Tidwells Meadow is what the locals call it or sometimes the Old Camp It was here that Sara Tidwell and her curious tribe built their cabins at least according to Marie Hingerman and once when I asked Bill Dean he agreed this was the place    although he didnt seem interested in continuing the conversation which struck me at the time as a bit odd I stood there for a moment looking down at the north end of Dark Score The water was glassy and calm still candycolored in the afterglow of sunset without a single ripple or a single small craft to be seen The boatpeople would all be down at the marina or at Warringtons Sunset Bar by now I guessed eating lobster rolls and drinking big mixed drinks Later a few of them buzzed on speed and martinis would go bolting up and down the lake by moonlight I wondered if I would be around to hear them I thought there was a fair chance that by then Id be on my way back to Derry either terrified by what Id found or disillusioned because I had found nothing at all You funny little man said Strickland I didnt know I was going to speak until the words were out of my mouth and why those words in particular I had no idea I remembered my dream of Jo under the bed and shuddered A mosquito whined in my ear I slapped it and walked on In the end my arrival at the head of the driveway was almost too perfectly timed the sense of having reentered my dream almost too complete Even the balloons tied to the SARA LAUGHS sign one white and one blue both with WELCOME BACK MIKE carefully printed on them in black ink and floating against the everdarkening backdrop of the trees seemed to intensify the dj vu I had quite deliberately induced for no two dreams are exactly the same are they Things conceived by minds and made by hands can never be quite the same even when they try their best to be identical because were never the same from day to day or even moment to moment I walked to the sign feeling the mystery of this place at twilight I squeezed down on the board feeling its rough reality and then I ran the ball of my thumb over the letters daring the splinters and reading with my skin like a blind man reading braille S and A and R and A L and A and U and G and H and S The driveway had been cleared of fallen needles and blowndown branches but Dark Score glimmered a fading rose just as it had in my dreams and the sprawled hulk of the house was the same Bill had thoughtfully left the light over the back stoop burning and the sunflowers growing through the boards had long since been cut down but everything else was the same I looked overhead at the slot of sky over the lane Nothing    I waited    and nothing    waiting still    and then there it was right where the center of my gaze had been trained At one moment there was only the fading sky with indigo just starting to rise up from the edges like an infusion of ink and at the next Venus was glowing there bright and steady People talk about watching the stars come out and I suppose some people do but I think that was the only time in my life that I actually saw one appear I wished on it too but this time it was real time and I did not wish for Jo Help me I said looking at the star I would have said more but I didnt know what to say I didnt know what kind of help I needed Thats enough a voice in my mind said uneasily Thats enough now Go on back and get your car Except that wasnt the plan The plan was to go down the driveway just as I had in the final dream the nightmare The plan was to prove to myself that there was no shroudwrapped monster lurking in the shadows of the big old log house down there The plan was pretty much based on that bit of New Age wisdom which says the word fear stands for Face Everything And Recover But as I stood there and looked down at that spark of porch light it looked very small in the growing darkness it occurred to me that theres another bit of wisdom one not quite so goodmorningstarshine which suggests fear is actually an acronym for Fuck Everything And Run Standing there by myself in the woods as the light left the sky that seemed like the smarter interpretation no two ways about it I looked down and was a little amused to see that I had taken one of the balloons  untied it without even noticing as I thought things over It floated serenely up from my hand at the end of its string the words printed on it now impossible to read in the growing dark Maybe its all moot anyway maybe I wont be able to move Maybe that old devil writers walk has got hold of me again and Ill just stand here like a statue until someone comes along and hauls me away But this was real time in the real world and in the real world there was no such thing as writers walk I opened my hand As the string Id been holding floated free I walked under the rising balloon and started down the driveway Foot followed foot pretty much as they had ever since Id first learned this trick back in  I went deeper and deeper into the clean but sour smell of pine and once I caught myself taking an extrabig step avoiding a fallen branch that had been in the dream but wasnt here in reality My heart was still thudding hard and sweat was still pouring out of me oiling my skin and drawing mosquitoes I raised a hand to brush the hair off my brow then stopped holding it splayfingered out in front of my eyes I put the other one next to it Neither was marked there wasnt even a shadow of scar from the cut Id given myself while crawling around my bedroom during the ice storm Im all right I said Im all right You funny little man said Strickland a voice answered It wasnt mine wasnt Jos it was the UFO voice that had narrated my nightmare the one which had driven me on even when I wanted to stop The voice of some outsider I started walking again I was better than halfway down the driveway now I had reached the point where in the dream I told the voice that I was afraid of Mrs Danvers Im afraid of Mrs D I said trying the words aloud in the growing dark What if the bad old housekeepers down there A loon cried on the lake but the voice didnt answer I suppose it didnt have to There was no Mrs Danvers she was only a bag of bones in an old book and the voice knew it I began walking again I passed the big pine that Jo had once banged into in our Jeep trying to back up the driveway How she had sworn Like a sailor I had managed to keep a straight face until she got to Fuck a duck and then Id lost it leaning against the side of the Jeep with the heels of my hands pressed against my temples howling until tears rolled down my cheeks and Jo glaring hot blue sparks at me the whole time I could see the mark about three feet up on the trunk of the tree the white seeming to float above the dark bark in the gloom It was just here that the unease which pervaded the other dreams had skewed into something far worse Even before the shrouded thing had come bursting out of the house I had felt something was all wrong all twisted up I had felt that somehow the house itself had gone insane It was at this point passing the old scarred pine that I had wanted to run like the gingerbread man I didnt feel that now I was afraid yes but not in terror There was nothing behind me for one thing no sound of slobbering breath The worst thing a man was likely to come upon in these woods was an irritated moose Or I supposed if he was really unlucky a pissedoff bear In the dream there had been a moon at least three quarters full but there was no moon in the sky above me that night Nor would there be in glancing over the weather page in that mornings Derry News I had noticed that the moon was new Even the most powerful dj vu is fragile and at the thought of that moonless sky mine broke The sensation of reliving my nightmare departed so abruptly that I even wondered why I had done this what I had hoped to prove or accomplish Now Id have to go all the way back down the dark lane to retrieve my car All right but Id do it with a flashlight from the house One of them would surely still be just inside the  A series of jagged explosions ran themselves off on the far side of the lake the last loud enough to echo against the hills I stopped drawing in a quick breath Moments before those unexpected bangs probably would have sent me running back up the driveway in a panic but now I had only that brief startled moment It was firecrackers of course the last one  the loudest one  maybe an M Tomorrow was the Fourth of July and across the lake kids were celebrating early as kids are wont to do I walked on The bushes still reached like hands but they had been pruned back and their reach wasnt very threatening I didnt have to worry about the power being out either I was now close enough to the back stoop to see moths fluttering around the light Bill Dean had left on for me Even if the power had been out in the western part of the state a lot of the lines are still above ground and it goes out a lot the gennie would have kicked in automatically Yet I was awed by how much of my dream was actually here even with the powerful sense of repetition  of reliving  departed Jos planters were where theyd always been flanking the path which leads down to Saras little lick of beach I suppose Brenda Meserve had found them stacked in the cellar and had had one of her crew set them out again Nothing was growing in them yet but I suspected that stuff would be soon And even without the moon of my dream I could see the black square on the water standing about fifty yards offshore The swimming float No oblong shape lying overturned in front of the stoop though no coffin Still my heart was beating hard again and I think if more firecrackers had gone off on the Kashwakamak side of the lake just then I might have screamed You funny little man said Strickland Give me that its my dustcatcher What if death drives us insane What if we survive but it drives us insane What then I had reached the point where in my nightmare the door banged open and that white shape came hurtling out with its wrapped arms upraised I took one more step and then stopped hearing the harsh sound of my respiration as I drew each breath down my throat and then pushed it back out over the dry floor of my tongue There was no sense of dj vu but for a moment I thought the shape would appear anyway  here in the real world in real time I stood waiting for it with my sweaty hands clenched I drew in another dry breath and this time I held it The soft lap of water against the shore A breeze that patted my face and rattled the bushes A loon cried out on the lake moths battered the stoop light No shroudmonster threw open the door and through the big windows to the left and right of the door I could see nothing moving white or otherwise There was a note above the knob probably from Bill and that was it I let out my breath in a rush and walked the rest of the way down the driveway to Sara Laughs The note was indeed from Bill Dean It said that Brenda had done some shopping for me the supermarket receipt was on the kitchen table and I would find the pantry well stocked with canned goods Shed gone easy with the perishables but there was milk butter halfandhalf and hamburger that staple of singleguy cuisine I will see you next Mon Bill had written If I had my druthers Id be here to say hello in person but the good wife says its our turn to do the holiday trotting and so we are going down to Virginia hot to spend the th with her sister If you need anything or run into problems    He had jotted his sisterinlaws phone number in Virginia as well as Butch Wigginss number in town which locals just call the TR as in Me and mother got tired of Bethel and moved our trailer over to the TR There were other numbers as well  the plumber the electrician Brenda Meserve even the TV guy over in Harrison who had repositioned the DSS dish for maximum reception Bill was taking no chances I turned the note over imagining a final PS Say Mike if nuclear war should break out before me and Yvette get back from Virginia  Something moved behind me I whirled on my heels the note dropping from my hand It fluttered to the boards of the back stoop like a larger whiter version of the moths banging the bulb overhead In that instant I was sure it would be the shroudthing an insane revenant in my wifes decaying body Give me my dustcatcher give it to me how dare you come down here and disturb my rest how dam you come to Manderley again and now that youre here how will you ever get away Into the mystery with you you silly little man Into the mystery with you Nothing there It had just been the breeze again stirring the bushes around a little    except I had felt no breeze against my sweaty skin not that time Well it must have been theres nothing there I said The sound of your voice when youre alone can be either scary or reassuring That time it was the latter I bent over picked up Bills note and stuffed it into my back pocket Then I rummaged out my keyring I stood under the stoop light in the big swooping shadows of the lightstruck moths picking through my keys until I found the one I wanted It had a funny disused look and as I rubbed my thumb along its serrated edge I wondered again why I hadnt come down here  except for a couple of quick broad daylight errands  in all the months and years since Jo had died Surely if she had been alive she would have insisted  But then a peculiar realization came to me it wasnt just a matter of since Jo died It was easy to think of it that way  never once during my six weeks on Key Largo had I thought of it any other way  but now actually standing here in the shadows of the dancing moths it was like standing under some weird organic disco ball and listening to the loons out on the lake I remembered that although Johanna had died in August of  she had died in Derry It had been miserably hot in the city    so why had we been there Why hadnt we been sitting out on our shady deck on the lake side of the house drinking iced tea in our bathing suits watching the boats go back and forth and commenting on the form of the various waterskiers What had she been doing in that damned Rite Aid parking lot to begin with when during any other August we would have been miles from there Nor was that all We usually stayed at Sara until the end of September  it was a peaceful pretty time as warm as summer But in  wed left with August only a week gone I knew because I could remember Johanna going to New York with me later that month some kind of publishing deal and the usual attendant publicity crap It had been doghot in Manhattan the hydrants spraying in the East Village and the uptown streets sizzling On one night of that trip wed seen The Phantom of the Opera Near the end Jo had leaned over to me and whispered Oh fuck The Phantom is snivelling again I had spent the rest of the show trying to keep from bursting into wild peals of laughter Jo could be evil that way Why had she come with me that August Jo didnt like New York even in April or October when its sort of pretty I didnt know I couldnt remember All I was sure of was that she had never been back to Sara Laughs after early August of     and before long I wasnt even sure of that I slipped the key into the lock and turned it Id go inside flip on the kitchen overheads grab a flashlight and go back for the car If I didnt some drunk guy with a cottage at the far south end of the lane would come in too fast rearend my Chevy and sue me for a billion dollars The house had been aired out and didnt smell a bit musty instead of still stale air there was a faint and pleasing aroma of pine I reached for the light inside the door and then somewhere in the blackness of the house a child began to sob My hand froze where it was and my flesh went cold I didnt panic exactly but all rational thought left my mind It was weeping a childs weeping but I hadnt a clue as to where it was coming from Then it began to fade Not to grow softer but to fade as if someone had picked that kid up and was carrying it away down some long corridor   not that any such corridor existed in Sara Laughs Even the one running through the middle of the house connecting the central section to the two wings isnt really long Fading    faded    almost gone I stood in the dark with my cold skin crawling and my hand on the lightswitch Part of me wanted to boogie to just go flying out of there as fast as my little legs could carry me running like the gingerbread man Another part however  the rational part  was already reasserting itself I flicked the switch the part that wanted to run saying forget it it wont work its the dream stupid its your dream coming true But it did work The foyer light came on in a shadowdispelling rush revealing Jos lumpy little pottery collection to the left and the bookcase to the right stuff I hadnt looked at in four years or more but still here and still the same On a middle shelf of the bookcase I could see the three early Elmore Leonard novels  Swag The Big Bounce and Mr Majestyk  that I had put aside against a spell of rainy weather you have to be ready for rain when youre at camp Without a good book even two days of rain in the woods can be enough to drive you bonkers There was a final whisper of weeping then silence In it I could hear ticking from the kitchen The clock by the stove one of Jos rare lapses into bad taste is Felix the Cat with big eyes that shift from side to side as his pendulum tail flicks back and forth I think its been in every cheap horror movie ever made Whos here I called I took a step toward the kitchen just a dim space floating beyond the foyer then stopped In the dark the house was a cavern The sound of the weeping could have come from anywhere Including my own imagination Is someone here No answer    but I didnt think the sound had been in my head If it had been writers block was the least of my worries Standing on the bookcase to the left of the Elmore Leonards was a longbarrelled flashlight the kind that holds eight Dcells and will temporarily blind you if someone shines it directly into your eyes I grasped it and until it nearly slipped through my hand I hadnt really realized how heavily I was sweating or how scared I was I juggled it heart beating hard halfexpecting that creepy sobbing to begin again halfexpecting the shroudthing to come floating out of the black living room with its shapeless arms raised some old hack of a politician back from the grave and ready to give it another shot Vote the straight Resurrection ticket brethren and you will be saved I got control of the light and turned it on It shot a bright straight beam into the living room picking out the moosehead over the fieldstone fireplace it shone in the heads glass eyes like two lights burning under water I saw the old caneandbamboo chairs the old couch the scarred diningroom table you had to balance by shimming one leg with a folded playing card or a couple of beer coasters I saw no ghosts I decided this was a seriously fuckedup carnival just the same In the words of the immortal Cole Porter lets call the whole thing off If I headed east as soon as I got back to my car I could be in Derry by midnight Sleeping in my own bed I turned out the foyer light and stood with the flash drawing its line across the dark I listened to the tick of that stupid catclock which Bill must have set going and to the familiar chugging cycle of the refrigerator As I listened to them I realized that I had never expected to hear either sound again As for the crying    Had there been crying Had there really Yes Crying or something Just what now seemed moot What seemed germane was that coming here had been a dangerous idea and a stupid course of action for a man who has taught his mind to misbehave As I stood in the foyer with no light but the flash and the glow falling in the windows from the bulb over the back stoop I realized that the line between what I knew was real and what I knew was only my imagination had pretty much disappeared I left the house checked to make sure the door was locked and walked back up the driveway swinging the flashlight beam from side to side like a pendulum  like the tail of old Felix the Krazy Kat in the kitchen It occurred to me as I struck north along the lane that I would have to make up some sort of story for Bill Dean It wouldnt do to say Well Bill I got down there and heard a kid bawling in my locked house and it scared me so bad I turned into the gingerbread man and ran back to Derry Ill send you the flashlight I took put it back on the shelf next to the paperbacks would you That wasnt any good because the story would get around and people would say Not surprised Wrote too many books probably Work like that has got to soften a mans head Now hes scared of his own shadow Occupational hazard Even if I never came down here again in my life I didnt want to leave people on the TR with that opinion of me that halfcontemptuous seewhatyougetforthinkingtoomuch attitude Its one a lot of folks seem to have about people who live by their imaginations Id tell Bill I got sick In a way it was true Or no    better to tell him someone else got sick    a friend    someone in Derry Id been seeing    a ladyfriend perhaps Bill this friend of mine this ladyfriend of mine got sick you see and so     I stopped suddenly the light shining on the front of my car I had walked the mile in the dark without noticing many of the sounds in the woods and dismissing even the bigger of them as deer settling down for the night I hadnt turned around to see if the shroudthing or maybe some spectral crying child was following me I had gotten involved in making up a story and then embellishing it doing it in my head instead of on paper this time but going down all the same wellknown paths I had gotten so involved that I had neglected to be afraid My heartbeat was back to normal the sweat was drying on my skin and the mosquitoes had stopped whining in my ears And as I stood there a thought occurred to me It was as if my mind had been waiting patiently for me to calm down enough so it could remind me of some essential fact The pipes Bill had gotten my goahead to replace most of the old stuff and the plumber had done so Very recently hed done so Air in the pipes I said running the beam of the eightcell flashlight over the grille of my Chevrolet Thats what I heard I waited to see if the deeper part of my mind would call this a stupid rationalizing lie It didnt    because I suppose it realized it could be true Airy pipes can sound like people talking dogs barking or children crying Perhaps the plumber had bled them and the sound had been something else    but perhaps he hadnt The question was whether or not I was going to jump in my car back two tenths of a mile to the highway and then return to Derry all on the basis of a sound I had heard for ten seconds maybe only five and while in an excited stressful state of mind I decided the answer was no It might take only one more peculiar thing to turn me around  probably gibbering like a character on Tales from the Crypt  but the sound Id heard in the foyer wasnt enough Not when making a go of it at Sara Laughs might mean so much I hear voices in my head and have for as long as I can remember I dont know if thats part of the necessary equipment for being a writer or not Ive never asked another one I never felt the need to because I know all the voices I hear are versions of me Still they often seem like very real versions of other people and none is more real to meor more familiar  than Jos voice Now that voice came sounding interested amused in an ironic but gentle way    and approving Going to fight Mike Yeah I said standing there in the dark and picking out gleams of chrome with my flashlight Think so babe Well then  thats all right isnt it Yes It was I got into my car started it up and drove slowly down the lane And when I got to the driveway I turned in There was no crying the second time I entered the house I walked slowly through the downstairs keeping the flashlight in my hand until I had turned on every light I could find if there were people still boating on the north end of the lake old Sara probably looked like some weird Spielbergian flying saucer hovering above them I think houses live their own lives along a timestream thats different from the ones upon which their owners float one thats slower In a house especially an old one the past is closer In my life Johanna had been dead nearly four years but to Sara she was much nearer than that It wasnt until I was actually inside with all the lights on and the flash returned to its spot on the bookshelf that I realized how much I had been dreading my arrival Of having my grief reawakened by signs of Johannas interrupted life A book with a corner turned down on the table at one end of the sofa where Jo had liked to recline in her nightgown reading and eating plums the cardboard cannister of Quaker Oats which was all she ever wanted for breakfast on a shelf in the pantry her old green robe hung on the back of the bathroom door in the south wing which Bill Dean still called the new wing although it had been built before we ever saw Sara Laughs Brenda Meserve had done a good job  a humane jobof removing these signs and signals but she couldnt get them all Jos hardcover set of Sayerss Peter Wimsey novels still held pride of place at the center of the livingroom bookcase Jo had always called the moosehead over the fireplace Bunter and once for no reason I could remember certainly it seemed a very unBunterlike accessory she had hung a bell around the mooses hairy neck It hung there still on a red velvet ribbon Mrs Meserve might have puzzled over that bell wondering whether to leave it up or take it down not knowing that when Jo and I made love on the livingroom couch and yes we were often overcome there we referred to the act as ringing Bunters bell Brenda Meserve had done her best but any good marriage is secret territory a necessary white space on societys map What others dont know about it is what makes it yours I walked around touching things looking at things seeing them new Jo seemed everywhere to me and after a little while I dropped into one of the old cane chairs in front of the TV The cushion wheezed under me and I could hear Jo saying Well excuse yourself Michael I put my face in my hands and cried I suppose it was the last of my mourning but that made it no easier to bear I cried until I thought something inside me would break if I didnt stop When it finally let me go my face was drenched I had the hiccups and I thought I had never felt so tired in my life I felt strained all over my body  partly from the walking Id done I suppose but mostly just from the tension of getting here    and deciding to stay here To fight That weird phantom crying Id heard when I first stepped into the place although it seemed very distant now hadnt helped I washed my face at the kitchen sink rubbing away the tears with the heels of my hands and clearing my clogged nose Then I carried my suitcases down to the guest bedroom in the north wing I had no intention of sleeping in the south wing in the master bedroom where I had last slept with Jo That was a choice Brenda Meserve had foreseen There was a bouquet of fresh wildflowers on the bureau and a card WELCOME BACK MR NOONAN If I hadnt been emotionally exhausted I suppose looking at that message in Mrs Meserves spiky copperplate handwriting would have brought on another fit of the weeps I put my face in the flowers and breathed deeply They smelled good like sunshine Then I took off my clothes leaving them where they dropped and turned back the coverlet on the bed Fresh sheets fresh pillowcases same old Noonan sliding between the former and dropping his head onto the latter I lay there with the bedside lamp on looking up at the shadows on the ceiling almost unable to believe I was in this place and this bed There had been no shroudthing to greet me of course    but I had an idea it might well find me in my dreams Sometimes  for me at least  theres a transitional bump between waking and sleeping Not that night I slipped away without knowing it and woke the next morning with sunlight shining in through the window and the bedside lamp still on There had been no dreams that I could remember only a vague sensation that I had awakened sometime briefly in the night and heard a bell ringing very thin and far away The little girl actually she wasnt much more than a babycame walking up the middle of Route  dressed in a red bathing suit yellow plastic flipflops and a Boston Red Sox baseball cap turned around backward I had just driven past the Lakeview General Store and Dickie Brookss AllPurpose Garage and the speed limit there drops from fiftyfive to thirtyfive Thank God I was obeying it that day otherwise I might have killed her It was my first day back Id gotten up late and spent most of the morning walking in the woods which run along the lakeshore seeing what was the same and what had changed The water looked a little lower and there were fewer boats than I would have expected especially on summers biggest holiday but otherwise I might never have been away I even seemed to be slapping at the same bugs Around eleven my stomach alerted me to the fact that Id skipped breakfast I decided a trip to the Village Cafe was in order The restaurant at Warringtons was trendier by far but Id be stared at there The Village Cafe would be better  if it was still doing business Buddy Jellison was an illtempered fuck but he had always been the best frycook in western Maine and what my stomach wanted was a big greasy Villageburger Now this little girl walking straight up the white line and looking like a majorette leading an invisible parade At thirtyfive miles per hour I saw her in plenty of time but this road was busy in the summer and very few people bothered creeping through the reducedspeed zone There were only a dozen Castle County police cruisers after all and not many of them bothered with the TR unless they were specifically called there I pulled over to the shoulder put the Chevy in PARK and was out before the dust had even begun to settle The day was muggy and close and still the clouds seeming low enough to touch The kid  a little blondie with a snub nose and scabbed knees  stood on the white line as if it were a tightrope and watched me approach with no more fear than a fawn Hi she said I go beach Mummy ont take me and Im mad as hell She stamped her foot to show she knew as well as anybody what mad as hell was all about Three or four was my guess Wellspoken in her fashion and cute as hell but still no more than three or four Well the beach is a good place to go on the Fourth all right I said but   Fourth of July and fireworks too she agreed making too sound exotic and sweet like a word in Vietnamese   but if you try to walk there on the highway youre more apt to wind up in Castle Rock Hospital I decided I wasnt going to stand there playing Mister Rogers with her in the middle of Route  not with a curve only fifty yards to the south and a car apt to come wheeling around it at sixty miles an hour at any time I could hear a motor actually and it was revving hard I picked the kid up and carried her over to where my car was idling and although she seemed perfectly content to be carried and not frightened a bit I felt like Chester the Molester the second I had my arm locked under her bottom I was very aware that anyone sitting around in the combined office and waiting room of Brooksies Garage could look out and see me This is one of the strange midlife realities of my generation we cant touch a child who isnt our own without fearing others will see something lecherous in our touching    or without thinking way down deep in the sewers of our psyches that there probably is something lecherous in it I got her out of the road though I did that much Let the Marching Mothers of Western Maine come after me and do their worst You take me beach the little girl asked She was brighteyed smiling I figured that shed probably be pregnant by the time she was twelve especially given the cool way she was wearing her baseball cap Got your suitie Actually I think I left my suitie at home Dont you hate that Honey wheres your mom As if in direct answer to my question the car Id heard came busting out of a road on the near side of the curve It was a Jeep Scout with mud splashed high up on both sides The motor was growling like something up a tree and pissed off about it A womans head was poked out the side window Little curies mom must have been too scared to sit down she was driving in a mad crouch and if a car had been coming around that particular curve in Route  when she pulled out my friend in the red bathing suit would likely have become an orphan on the spot The Scout fishtailed the head dropped back down inside the cab and there was a grinding as the driver upshifted trying to take her old heap from zero to sixty in maybe nine seconds If pure terror could have done the job Im sure she would have succeeded Thats Mattie the girl in the bathing suit said Im mad at her Im running away to have a Fourth at the beach If shes mad I go to my white nana I had no idea what she was talking about but it did cross my mind that Miss Bosox of  could have her Fourth at the beach I would settle for a fifth of something wholegrain at home Meanwhile I was waving the arm not under the kids butt back and forth over my head and hard enough to blow around wisps of the girls fine blonde hair Hey I shouted Hey lady I got her The Scout sped by still accelerating and still sounding pissed off about it The exhaust was blowing clouds of blue smoke There was a further hideous grinding from the Scouts old transmission It was like some crazy version of Lets Make a Deal Mattie youve succeeded in getting into second gear  would you like to quit and take the Maytag washer or do you want to try for third I did the only thing I could think of which was to step out onto the road turn toward the Jeep which was now speeding away from me the smell of the oil was thick and acrid and hold the kid up high over my head hoping Mattie would see us in her rearview mirror I no longer felt like Chester the Molester now I felt like a cruel auctioneer in a Disney cartoon offering the cutest lil piglet in the litter to the highest bidder It worked though The Scouts mudcaked taillights came on and there was a demonic howling as the badly used brakes locked Right in front of Brooksies this was If there were any oldtimers in for a good Fourth of July gossip they would now have plenty to gossip about I thought they would especially enjoy the part where Mom screamed at me to unhand her baby When you return to your summer home after a long absence its always nice to get off on the right foot The backup lights flared and the Jeep began reversing down the road at a good twenty miles an hour Now the transmission sounded not pissed off but panicky  please it was saying please stop youre killing me The Scouts rear end wagged from side to side like the tail of a happy dog I watched it coming at me hypnotized  now in the northbound lane now across the white line and into the southbound lane now overcorrecting so that the lefthand tires spumed dust off the shoulder Mattie go fast my new girlfriend said in a conversational isntthisinteresting voice She had one arm slung around my neck we were chums by God But what the kid said woke me up Mattie go fast all right too fast Mattie would more likely than not clean out the rear end of my Chevrolet And if I just stood here Baby Snooks and I were apt to end up as toothpaste between the two vehicles I backed the length of my car keeping my eyes fixed on the Jeep and yelling Slow down Mattie Slow down Cutiepie liked that Syo down she yelled starting to laugh Syo down you old Mattie syo down The brakes screamed in fresh agony The Jeep took one last walloping unhappy jerk backward as Mattie stopped without benefit of the clutch That final lunge took the Scouts rear bumper so close to the rear bumper of my Chevy that you could have bridged the gap with a cigarette The smell of oil in the air was huge and furry The kid was waving a hand in front of her face and coughing theatrically The drivers door flew open Mattie Devore flew out like a circus acrobat shot from a cannon if you can imagine a circus acrobat dressed in old paisley shorts and a cotton smock top My first thought was that the little girls big sister had been babysitting her that Mattie and Mummy were two different people I knew that little kids often spend a period of their development calling their parents by their first names but this palecheeked blonde girl looked all of twelve fourteen at the outside I decided her mad handling of the Scout hadnt been terror for her child or not just terror but total automotive inexperience There was something else too okay Another assumption that I made The muddy fourwheeldrive the baggy paisley shorts the smock that all but screamed Kmart the long yellow hair held back with those little red elastics and most of all the inattention that allows the threeyearold in your care to go wandering off in the first place    all those things said trailertrash to me I know how that sounds but I had some basis for it Also Im Irish goddammit My ancestors were trailertrash when the trailers were still horsedrawn caravans Stinkyphew the little girl said still waving a pudgy hand at the air in front of her face Scoutie stink Where Scouties bathing suitie I thought and then my new girlfriend was snatched out of my arms Now that she was closer my idea that Mattie was the bathing beautys sister took a hit Mattie wouldnt be middleaged until well into the next century but she wasnt twelve or fourteen either I now guessed twenty maybe a year younger When she snatched the baby away I saw the wedding ring on her left hand I also saw the dark circles under her eyes gray skin dusting to purple She was young but I thought it was a mothers terror and exhaustion I was looking at I expected her to swat the tot because thats how trailertrash moms react to being tired and scared When she did I would stop her one way or another distract her into turning her anger on me if that was what it took There was nothing very noble in this I should add all I really wanted to do was to postpone the fannywhacking shouldershaking and inyourface shouting to a time and place where I wouldnt have to watch it It was my first day back in town I didnt want to spend any of it watching an inattentive slut abuse her child Instead of shaking her and shouting Where did you think you were going you little bitch Mattie first hugged the child who hugged back enthusiastically showing absolutely no sign of fear and then covered her face with kisses Why did you do that she cried What was in your head When I couldnt find you I died Mattie burst into tears The child in the bathing suit looked at her with an expression of surprise so big and complete it would have been comical under other circumstances Then her own face crumpled up I stood back watched them crying and hugging and felt ashamed of my preconceptions A car went by and slowed down An elderly couple  Ma and Pa Kettle on their way to the store for that holiday box of GrapeNuts  gawked out I gave them an impatient wave with both hands the kind that says what are you staring at go on put an egg in your shoe and beat it They sped up but I didnt see an outofstate license plate as Id hoped I might This version of Ma and Pa were locals and the story would be fleeting its rounds soon enough Mattie the teenage bride and her little bundle of joy said bundle undoubtedly conceived in the back seat of a car or the bed of a pickup truck some months before the legitimizing ceremony bawling their eyes out at the side of the road With a stranger No not exactly a stranger Mike Noonan the writer fella from upstate I wanted to go to the beach and suhsuhswim the little girl wept and now it was swim that sounded exotic  the Vietnamese word for ecstasy perhaps I said Id take you this afternoon Mattie was still sniffing but getting herself under control Dont do that again little guy please dont you ever do that again Mommy was so scared I wont the kid said I really wont Still crying she hugged the older girl tight laying her head against the side of Matties neck Her baseball cap fell off I picked it up beginning to feel very much like an outsider here I poked the blueandred cap at Matties hand until her fingers closed on it I decided I also felt pretty good about the way things had turned out and maybe I had a right to Ive presented the incident as if it was amusing and it was but it was the sort of amusing you never see until later When it was happening it was terrifying Suppose there had been a truck coming from the other direction Coming around that curve and coming too fast A vehicle did come around it a pickup of the type no tourist ever drives Two more locals gawked their way by Maam I said Mattie I think Id better get going Glad your little girl is all right The minute it was out I felt an almost irresistible urge to laugh I could picture me drawling this speech to Mattie a name that belonged in a movie like Unforgiven or True Grit if any name ever did with my thumbs hooked into the belt of my chaps and my Stetson pushed back to reveal my noble brow I felt an insane urge to add Youre right purty maam aint you the new schoolteacher She turned to me and I saw that she was right purty Even with circles under her eyes and her blonde hair sticking off in gobs to either side of her head And I thought she was doing okay for a girl probably not yet old enough to buy a drink in a bar At least she hadnt belted the baby Thank you so much she said Was she right in the road Say she wasnt her eyes begged At least say she was walking along the shoulder Well   I walked on the line the girl said pointing Its like the crossmock Her voice took on a faintly righteous tone Crossmock is safe Matties cheeks already white turned whiter I didnt like seeing her that way and didnt like to think of her driving home that way especially with a kid Where do you live Mrs   Devore she said Im Mattie Devore She shifted the child and put out her hand I shook it The morning was warm and it was going to be hot by midafternoon  beach weather for sure  but the fingers I touched were icy We live just there She pointed to the intersection the Scout had shot out of and I could see  surprise surprise  a doublewide trailer set off in a grove of pines about two hundred feet up the little feeder road Wasp Hill Road I recalled It ran about half a mile from Route  to the water  what was known as the Middle Bay Ah yes doc its all coming back to me now Im once more riding the Dark Score range Saving little kids is my specialty Still I was relieved to see that she lived close by  less than a quarter of a mile from the place where our respective vehicles were parked with their tails almost touching  and when I thought about it it stood to reason A child as young as the bathing beauty couldnt have walked far    although this one had already demonstrated a fair degree of determination I thought Mothers haggard look was even more suggestive of the daughters will I was glad I was too old to be one of her future boyfriends she would have them jumping through hoops all through high school and college Hoops of fire likely Well the highschool part anyway Girls from the doublewide side of town did not as a general rule go to college unless there was a juco or a voketech handy And she would only have them jumping until the right boy or more likely the wrong one came sweeping around the Great Curve of Life and ran her down in the highway her all the while unaware that the white line and the crossmock were two different things Then the whole cycle would repeat itself Christ almighty Noonan quit it I told myself Shes three years old and youve already got her with three kids of her own two with ringworm and one retarded Thank you so much Mattie repeated Thats okay I said and snubbed the little girls nose Although her cheeks were still wet with tears she grinned at me sunnily enough in response This is a very verbal little girl Very verbal and very willful Now Mattie did give her child a little shake but the kid showed no fear no sign that shaking or hitting was the order of most days On the contrary her smile widened Her mother smiled back And yes  once you got past the sloppedtogether look of her she was most extraordinarily pretty Put her in a tennis dress at the Castle Rock Country Club where shed likely never go in her life except maybe as a maid or a waitress and she would maybe be more than pretty A young Grace Kelly perhaps Then she looked back at me her eyes very wide and grave Mr Noonan Im not a bad mother she said I felt a start at my name coming from her mouth but it was only momentary She was the right age after all and my books were probably better for her than spending her afternoons in front of General Hospital and One Life to Live A little anyway We had an argument about when we were going to the beach I wanted to hang out the clothes have lunch and go this afternoon Kyra wanted   She broke off What What did I say Her name is Kia Did   Before I could say anything else the most extraordinary thing happened my mouth was full of water So full I felt a moments panic like someone who is swimming in the ocean and swallows a wavewash Only this wasnt a salt taste it was cold and fresh with a faint metal tang like blood I turned my head aside and spat I expected a gush of liquid to pour out of my mouth  the sort of gush you sometimes get when commencing artificial respiration on a neardrowning victim What came out instead was what usually comes out when you spit on a hot day a little white pellet And that sensation was gone even before the little white pellet struck the dirt of the shoulder In an instant as if it had never been there That man spirted the girl said matteroffactly Sorry I said I was also bewildered What in Gods name had that been about I guess I had a little delayed reaction Mattie looked concerned as though I were eighty instead of forty I thought that maybe to a girl her age forty is eighty Do you want to come up to the house Ill give you a glass of water No Im fine now All right Mr Noonan    all I mean is that nothing like this has ever happened to me before I was hanging sheets    she was inside watching a Mighty Mouse cartoon on the VCR    then when I went in to get more pins     She looked at the girl who was no longer smiling It was starting to get through to her now Her eyes were big and ready to fill with tears She was gone I thought for a minute Id die of fear Now the kids mouth began to tremble and her eyes filled up right on schedule She began to weep Mattie stroked her hair soothing the small head until it lay against the Kmart smock top Thats all right Ki she said It turned out okay this time but you cant go out in the road Its dangerous Little things get run over in the road and youre a little thing The most precious little thing in the world She cried harder It was the exhausted sound of a child who needed a nap before any more adventures to the beach or anywhere else Kia bad Kia bad she sobbed against her mothers neck No honey only three Mattie said and if I had harbored any further thoughts about her being a bad mother they melted away then Or perhaps theyd already gone  after all the kid was round comely wellkept and unbruised On one level those things registered On another I was trying to cope with the strange thing that had just happened and the equally strange thing I thought I was hearing  that the little girl I had carried off the white line had the name we had planned to give our child if our child turned out to be a girl Kia I said Marvelled really As if my touch might break her I tentatively stroked the back of her head Her hair was sunwarm and fine No Mattie said Thats the best she can say it now Kyra not Kia Its from the Greek It means ladylike She shifted a little selfconscious I picked it out of a babyname book While I was pregnant I kind of went Oprah Better than going postal I guess Its a lovely name I said And I dont think youre a bad mom What went through my mind right then was a story Frank Arlen had told over a meal at Christmas  it had been about Petie the youngest brother and Frank had had the whole table in stitches Even Petie who claimed not to remember a bit of the incident laughed until tears streamed down his cheeks One Easter Frank said when Petie was about five their folks had gotten them up for an Easteregg hunt The two parents had hidden over a hundred colored hardboiled eggs around the house the evening before after getting the kids over to their grandparents A high old Easter morning was had by all at least until Johanna looked up from the patio where she was counting her share of the spoils and shrieked There was Petie crawling gaily around on the secondfloor overhang at the back of the house not six feet from the drop to the concrete patio Mr Arlen had rescued Petie while the rest of the family stood below holding hands frozen with horror and fascination Mrs Arlen had repeated the Hail Mary over and over so fast she sounded like one of the Chipmunks on that old Witch Doctor record Frank had said laughing harder than ever until her husband had disappeared back into the open bedroom window with Petie in his arms Then she had swooned to the pavement breaking her nose When asked for an explanation Petie had told them hed wanted to check the raingutter for eggs I suppose every family has at least one story like that the survival of the worlds Peties and Kyras is a convincing argument  in the minds of parents anyway for the existence of God I was so scared Mattie said now looking fourteen again Fifteen at most But its over I said And Kyras not going to go walking in the road anymore Are you Kyra She shook her head against her mothers shoulder without raising it I had an idea shed probably be asleep before Mattie got her back to the good old doublewide You dont know how bizarre this is for me Mattie said One of my favorite writers comes out of nowhere and saves my kid I knew you had a place on the TR that big old log house everyone calls Sara Laughs but folks say you dont come here anymore since your wife died For a long time I didnt I said If Sara was a marriage instead of a house youd call this a trial reconciliation She smiled fleetingly then looked grave again I want to ask you for something A favor Ask away Dont talk about this Its not a good time for Ki and me Why not She bit her lip and seemed to consider answering the question  one I might not have asked given an extra moment to consider  and then shook her head Its just not And Id be so grateful if you didnt talk about what just happened in town More grateful than youll ever know No problem You mean it Sure Im basically a summer person who hasnt been around for awhile    which means I dont have many folks to talk to anyway There was Bill Dean of course but I could keep quiet around him Not that he wouldnt know If this little lady thought the locals werent going to find out about her daughters attempt to get to the beach by shanks mare she was fooling herself I think weve been noticed already though Take a look up at Brooksies Garage Peek dont stare She did and sighed Two old men were standing on the tarmac where there had been gas pumps once upon a time One was very likely Brooksie himself I thought I could see the remnants of the flyaway red hair which had always made him look like a downeast version of Bozo the Clown The other old enough to make Brooksie look like a wee slip of a lad was leaning on a goldheaded cane in a way that was queerly vulpine I cant do anything about them she said sounding depressed Nobody can do anything about them I guess I should count myself lucky its a holiday and theres only two of them Besides I added they probably didnt see much Which ignored two things first that half a dozen cars and pickemups had gone by while we had been standing here and second that whatever Brooksie and his elderly friend hadnt seen they would be more than happy to make up On Matties shoulder Kyra gave a ladylike snore Mattie glanced at her and gave her a smile full of rue and love Im sorry we had to meet under circumstances that make me look like such a dope because I really am a big fan They say at the bookstore in Castle Rock that youve got a new one coming out this summer I nodded Its called Helens Promise She grinned Good title Thanks You better get your buddy back home before she breaks your arm Yeah There are people in this world who have a knack for asking embarrassing awkward questions without meaning to  its like a talent for walking into doors I am one of that tribe and as I walked with her toward the passenger side of the Scout I found a good one And yet it was hard to blame myself too enthusiastically I had seen the wedding ring on her hand after all Will you tell your husband Her smile stayed on but it paled somehow And tightened If it were possible to delete a spoken question the way you can delete a line of type when youre writing a story I would have done it He died last August Mattie Im sorry Open mouth insert foot You couldnt know A girl my age isnt even supposed to be married is she And if she is her husbands supposed to be in the army or something There was a pink babyseat  also Kmart I guessed  on the passenger side of the Scout Mattie tried to boost Kyra in but I could see she was struggling I stepped forward to help her and for just a moment as I reached past her to grab a plump leg the back of my hand brushed her breast She couldnt step back unless she wanted to risk Kyras slithering out of the seat and onto the floor but I could feel her recording the touch My husbands dead not a threat so the bigdeal writer thinks its okay to cop a little feel on a hot summer morning And what can I say Mr Big Deal came along and hauled my kid out of the road maybe saved her life No Mattie I may be forty going on a hundred but I was not copping a feel Except I couldnt say that it would only make things worse I felt my cheeks flush a little How old are you I asked when we had the baby squared away and were back at a safe distance She gave me a look Tired or not she had it together again Old enough to know the situation Im in She held out her hand Thanks again Mr Noonan God sent you along at the right time Nah God just told me I needed a hamburger at the Village Cafe I said Or maybe it was His opposite number Please say Buddys still doing business at the same old stand She smiled It warmed her face back up again and I was happy to see it Hell still be there when Kis kids are old enough to try buying beer with fake IDS Unless someone wanders in off the road and asks for something like shrimp tetrazzini If that happened hed probably drop dead of a heart attack Yeah Well when I get copies of the new book Ill drop one off The smile continued to hang in there but now it shaded toward caution You dont need to do that Mr Noonan No but I will My agent gets me fifty comps I find that as I get older they go further Perhaps she heard more in my voice than I had meant to put there  people do sometimes I guess All right Ill look forward to it I took another look at the baby sleeping in that queerly casual way they have  her head tilted over on her shoulder her lovely little lips pursed and blowing a bubble Their skin is what kills me  so fine and perfect there seem to be no pores at all Her Sox hat was askew Mattie watched me reach in and readjust it so the visors shade fell across her closed eyes Kyra I said Mattie nodded Ladylike Kia is an African name I said It means seasons beginning I left her then giving her a little wave as I headed back to the drivers side of the Chevy I could feel her curious eyes on me and I had the oddest feeling that I was going to cry That feeling stayed with me long after the two of them were out of sight was still with me when I got to the Village Cafe I pulled into the dirt parking lot to the left of the offbrand gas pumps and just sat there for a little while thinking about Jo and about a home pregnancytesting kit which had cost twentytwofifty A little secret shed wanted to keep until she was absolutely sure That must have been it what else could it have been Kia I said Seasons beginning But that made me feel like crying again so I got out of the car and slammed the door hard behind me as if I could keep the sadness inside that way Buddy Jellison was just the same all right same dirty cooks whites and splotchy white apron same flyaway gray hair under a paper cap stained with either beefblood or strawberry juice Even from the look the same oatmealcookie crumbs caught in his ragged mustache He was maybe fiftyfive and maybe seventy which in some genetically favored men seems to be still within the farthest borders of middle age He was huge and shambly  probably sixfour three hundred pounds  and just as full of grace wit and joie de vivre as he had been four years before You want a menu or do you remember he grunted as if Id last been in yesterday You still make the Villageburger Deluxe Does a crow still shit in the pine tops Pale eyes regarding me No condolences which was fine by me Most likely Ill have one with everything  a Villageburger not a crow  plus a chocolate frappe Good to see you again I offered my hand He looked surprised but touched it with his own Unlike the whites the apron and the hat the hand was clean Even the nails were clean Yuh he said then turned to the sallow woman chopping onions beside the grill Villageburger Audrey he said Drag it through the garden Im ordinarily a sitatthecounter kind of guy but that day I took a booth near the cooler and waited for Buddy to yell that it was ready  Audrey shortorders but she doesnt waitress I wanted to think and Buddys was a good place to do it There were a couple of locals eating sandwiches and drinking sodas straight from the can but that was about it people with summer cottages would have to be starving to eat at the Village Cafe and even then youd likely have to haul them through the door kicking and screaming The floor was faded green linoleum with a rolling topography of hills and valleys Like Buddys uniform it was none too clean the summer people who came in probably failed to notice his hands The woodwork was greasy and dark Above it where the plaster started there were a number of bumperstickers  Buddys idea of decoration HORN BROKEN  WATCH FOR FINGER WIFE AND DOG MISSING REWARD FOR DOG THERES NO TOWN DRUNK HERE WE ALL TAKE TURNS Humor is almost always anger with its makeup on I think but in little towns the makeup tends to be thin Three overhead fans paddled apathetically at the hot air and to the left of the softdrink cooler were two dangling strips of flypaper both liberally stippled with wildlife some of it still struggling feebly If you could look at those and still eat your digestion was probably doing okay I thought about a similarity of names which was surely had to be a coincidence I thought about a young pretty girl who had become a mother at sixteen or seventeen and a widow at nineteen or twenty I thought about inadvertently touching her breast and how the world judged men in their forties who suddenly discovered the fascinating world of young women and their accessories Most of all I thought of the queer thing that had happened to me when Mattie had told me the kids name  that sense that my mouth and throat were suddenly flooded with cold mineraltangy water That rush When my burger was ready Buddy had to call twice When I went over to get it he said You back to stay or to clear out Why I asked Did you miss me Buddy Nup he said but at least youre from instate Did you know that Massachusetts is Piscataqua for asshole Youre as funny as ever I said Yuh Im going on fuckin Letterman Explain to him why God gave seagulls wings Why was that Buddy So they could beat the fuckin Frenchmen to the dump I got a newspaper from the rack and a straw for my frappe Then I detoured to the pay phone and tucking my paper under my arm opened the phone book You could actually walk around with it if you wanted it wasnt tethered to the phone Who after all would want to steal a Castle County telephone directory There were over twenty Devores which didnt surprise me very much  its one of those names like Pelkey or Bowie or Toothaker that you kept coming across if you lived down here I imagine its the same everywhere  some families breed more and travel less thats all There was a Devore listing for RD Wsp HI Rd but it wasnt for a Mattie Mathilda Martha or M It was for Lance I looked at the front of the phone book and saw it was a  model printed and mailed while Matties husband was still in the land of the living Okay    but there was something else about that name Devore Devore let us now praise famous Devores wherefore art thou Devore But it wouldnt come whatever it was I ate my burger drank my liquefied ice cream and tried not to look at what was caught on the flypaper While I was waiting for the sallow silent Audrey to give me my change you could still eat all week in the Village Cafe for fifty dollars    if your bloodvessels could stand it that was I read the sticker pasted to the cash register It was another Buddy Jellison special CYBERSPACE SCARED ME SO BAD I DOWNLOADED IN MY PANTS This didnt exactly convulse me with mirth but it did provide the key for solving one of the days mysteries why the name Devore had seemed not just familiar but evocative I was financially well off rich by the standards of many There was at least one person with ties to the TR however who was rich by the standards of everybody and filthy rich by the standards of most yearround residents of the lakes region If that was he was still eating breathing and walking around Audrey is Max Devore still alive She gave me a little smile Oh ayuh But we dont see him in here too often That got the laugh out of me that all of Buddys joke stickers hadnt been able to elicit Audrey who had always been yellowish and who now looked like a candidate for a liver transplant snickered herself Buddy gave us a librarians prim glare from the far end of the counter where he was reading a flyer about the holiday NASCAR race at Oxford Plains I drove back the way I had come A big hamburger is a bad meal to eat in the middle of a hot day it leaves you feeling sleepy and heavywitted All I wanted was to go home Id been there less than twentyfour hours and was already thinking of it as home flop on the bed in the north bedroom under the revolving fan and sleep for a couple of hours When I passed Wasp Hill Road I slowed down The laundry was hanging listlessly on the lines and there was a scatter of toys in the front yard but the Scout was gone Mattie and Kyra had donned their suities I imagined and headed on down to the public beachie Id liked them both and quite a lot Matties shortlived marriage had probably hooked her somehow to Max Devore    but looking at the rusty doublewide trailer with its dirt driveway and balding front yard remembering Matties baggy shorts and Kmart smock top I had to doubt that the hook was a strong one Before retiring to Palm Springs in the late eighties Maxwell William Devore had been a driving force in the computer revolution Its primarily a young peoples revolution but Devore did okay for a golden oldie  knew the playingfield and understood the rules He started when memory was stored on magnetic tape instead of in computer chips and a warehousesized cruncher called UNIVAC was stateoftheart He was fluent in COBOL and spoke FORTRAN like a native As the field expanded beyond his ability to keep up expanded to the point where it began to define the world he bought the talent he needed to keep growing His company Visions had created scanning programs which could upload hard copy onto floppy disks almost instantaneously it created graphicimaging programs which had become the industry standard it created Pixel Easel which allowed laptop users to mousepaint    to actually fingerpaint if their gadget came equipped with what Jo had called the clitoral cursor Devore had invented none of this later stuff but hed understood that it could be invented and had hired people to do it He held dozens of patents and coheld hundreds more He was supposedly worth something like six hundred million dollars depending on how technology stocks were doing on any given day On the TR he was reputed to be crusty and unpleasant No surprise there to a Nazarene can any good thing come out of Nazareth And folks said he was eccentric of course Listen to the oldtimers who remember the rich and successful in their salad days and all the oldtimers claim they do and youll hear that they ate the wallpaper fucked the dog and showed up at church suppers wearing nothing but their peestained BVDS Even if all that was true in Devores case and even if he was Scrooge McDuck in the bargain I doubted that hed allow two of his closer relatives to live in a doublewide trailer I drove up the lane above the lake then paused at the head of my driveway looking at the sign there SARA LAUGHS burned into a length of varnished board nailed to a handy tree Its the way they do things down here Looking at it brought back the last dream of the Manderley series In that dream someone had slapped a radiostation sticker on the sign the way youre always seeing stickers slapped on turnpike tollcollection baskets in the exactchange lanes I got out of my car went to the sign and studied it No sticker The sunflowers had been down there growing out of the stoop  I had a photo in my suitcase that proved it  but there was no radiostation sticker on the house sign Proving exactly what Come on Noonan get a grip I started back to the car  the door was open the Beach Boys spilling out of the speakers  then changed my mind and went back to the sign again In the dream the sticker had been pasted just above the RA of SARA and the LAU of LAUGHS I touched my fingers to that spot and thought they came away feeling slightly sticky Of course that could have been the feel of varnish on a hot day Or my imagination I drove down to the house parked set the emergency brake on the slopes around Dark Score and the dozen or so other lakes in western Maine you always set your brake and listened to the rest of Dont Worry Baby which Ive always thought was the best of the Beach Boys songs great not in spite of the sappy lyrics but because of them If you knew how much I love you baby Brian Wilson sings nothing could go wrong with you And oh folks wouldnt that be a world I sat there listening and looked at the cabinet set against the right side of the stoop We kept our garbage in there to foil the neighborhood raccoons Even cans with snapdown lids wont always do that if the coons are hungry enough they somehow manage the lids with their clever little hands Youre not going to do what youre thinking of doing I told myself I mean    are you It seemed I was  or that I was at least going to have a go When the Beach Boys gave way to Rare Earth I got out of the car opened the storage cabinet and pulled out two plastic garbage cans There was a guy named Stan Proulx who came down to yank the trash twice a week or there was four years ago I reminded myself one of Bill Deans farflung network of parttimers working for cash off the books but I didnt think Stan would have been down to collect the current accumulation of swill because of the holiday and I was right There were two plastic garbage bags in each can I hauled them out cursing myself for a fool even while I was doing it and untwisted the yellow ties I really dont think I was so obsessed that I would have dumped a bunch of wet garbage out on my stoop if it had come to that of course Ill never know for sure and maybe thats for the best but it didnt No one had lived in the house for four years remember and its occupancy that produces garbage  everything from coffeegrounds to used sanitary napkins The stuff in these bags was dry trash swept together and carted out by Brenda Meserves cleaning crew There were nine vacuumcleaner disposal bags containing fortyeight months of dust dirt and dead flies There were wads of paper towels some smelling of aromatic furniture polish and others of the sharper but still pleasant aroma of Windex There was a moldy mattress pad and a silk jacket which had that unmistakable dineduponbymoths look The jacket certainly caused me no regrets a mistake of my young manhood it looked like something from the Beatles I Am the Walrus era Googoojoob baby There was a box filled with broken glass    another filled with unrecognizable and presumably outofdate plumbing fixtures    a torn and filthy square of carpet    donetodeath dishtowels faded and ragged    the old ovengloves Id used when cooking burgers and chicken on the barbecue    The sticker was in a twist at the bottom of the second bag Id known I would find it  from the moment Id felt that faintly tacky patch on the sign Id known  but Id needed to see it for myself The same way old Doubting Thomas had needed to get the blood under his fingernails I suppose I placed my find on a board of the sunwarmed stoop and smoothed it out with my hand It was shredded around the edges I guessed Bill had probably used a puttyknife to scrape it off He hadnt wanted Mr Noonan to come back to the lake after four years and discover some beeredup kid had slapped a radiostation sticker on his driveway sign Gorry no twouldnt be proper deah So off it had come and into the trash it had gone and here it was again another piece of my nightmare unearthed and not much the worse for wear I ran my fingers over it WBLM  PORTLANDS ROCK AND ROLL BLIMP I told myself didnt have to be afraid That it meant nothing just as all the rest of it meant nothing Then I got the broom out of the cabinet swept all the trash together and dumped it back in the plastic bags The sticker went in with the rest I went inside meaning to shower the dust and grime away then spied my own bathing suitie still lying in one of my open suitcases and decided to go swimming instead The suit was a jolly number covered with spouting whales that I had purchased in Key Largo I thought my pal in the Bosox cap would have approved I checked my watch and saw that I had finished my Villageburger fortyfive minutes ago Close enough for government work Kemo sabe especially after engaging in an energetic game of TrashBag Treasure Hunt I pulled on my suit and walked down the railroadtie steps which lead from Sara to the water My flipflops snapped and flapped A few late mosquitoes hummed The lake gleamed in front of me still and inviting under that low humid sky Running north and south along its edge bordering the entire east side of the lake was a rightofway path its called common property in the deeds which folks on the TR simply call The Street If one were to turn left onto The Street at the foot of my steps one could walk all the way down to the Dark Score Marina passing Warringtons and Buddy Jellisons scuzzy little eatery on the way    not to mention four dozen summer cottages discreetly tucked into sloping groves of spruce and pine Turn right and you could walk to Halo Bay although it would take you a day to do it with The Street overgrown the way it is now I stood there for a moment on the path then ran forward and leaped into the water Even as I flew through the air with the greatest of ease it occurred to me that the last time I had jumped in like this I had been holding my wifes hand Touching down was almost a catastrophe The water was cold enough to remind me that I was forty not fourteen and for a moment my heart stopped dead in my chest As Dark Score Lake closed over my head I felt quite sure that I wasnt going to come up alive Id be found drifting facedown between the swimming float and my little stretch of The Street a victim of cold water and a greasy Villageburger Theyd carve Your Mother Always Said To Wait At Least An Hour on my tombstone Then my feet landed in the stones and slimy weedstuff growing along the bottom my heart kickstarted and I shoved upward like a guy planning to slamdunk home the last score of a close basketball game As I returned to the air I gasped Water went in my mouth and I coughed it back out patting one hand against my chest in an effort to encourage my heart  come on baby keep going you can do it I came back down standing waistdeep in the lake and with my mouth full of that cold taste  lakewater with an undertinge of minerals the kind youd have to correct for when you washed your clothes It was exactly what I had tasted while standing on the shoulder of Route  It was what I had tasted when Mattie Devore told me her daughters name I made a psychological connection thats all From the similarity of the names to my dead wife to this lake Which  Which I have tasted a time or two before I said out loud As if to underline the fact I scooped up a palmful of water  some of the cleanest and clearest in the state according to the analysis reports I and all the other members of the socalled Western Lakes Association get each year  and drank it down There was no revelation no sudden weird flashes in my head It was just Dark Score first in my mouth and then in my stomach I swam out to the float climbed the threerung ladder on the side and flopped on the hot boards feeling suddenly very glad I had come In spite of everything Tomorrow I would start putting together some sort of life down here    trying to anyway For now it was enough to be lying with my head in the crook of one arm on the verge of a doze confident that the days adventures were over As it happened that was not quite true During our first summer on the TR Jo and I discovered it was possible to see the Castle Rock fireworks show from the deck overlooking the lake I remembered this just as it was drawing down toward dark and thought that this year I would spend that time in the living room watching a movie on the video player Reliving all the Fourth of July twilights we had spent out there drinking beer and laughing as the big ones went off would be a bad idea I was lonely enough without that lonely in a way of which I had not been conscious in Derry Then I wondered what I had come down here for if not to finally face Johannas memory  all of it  and put it to loving rest Certainly the possibility of writing again had never seemed more distant than it did that night There was no beer  Id forgotten to get a sixpack either at the General Store or at the Village Cafe  but there was soda courtesy of Brenda Meserve I got a can of Pepsi and settled in to watch the lightshow hoping it wouldnt hurt too much Hoping I supposed that I wouldnt cry Not that I was kidding myself there were more tears here all right Id just have to get through them The first explosion of the night had just gone off a spangly burst of blue with the bang travelling far behind  when the phone rang It made me jump as the faint explosion from Castle Rock had not I decided it was probably Bill Dean calling longdistance to see if I was settling in all right In the summer before Jo died wed gotten a wireless phone so we could prowl the downstairs while we talked a thing we both liked to do I went through the sliding glass door into the living room punched the pickup button and said Hello this is Mike as I went back to my deckchair and sat down Far across the lake exploding below the low clouds hanging over Castle View were green and yellow starbursts followed by soundless flashes that would eventually reach me as noise For a moment there was nothing from the phone and then a mans raspy voice  an elderly voice but not Bill Deans  said Noonan Mr Noonan Yes A huge spangle of gold lit up the west shivering the low clouds with brief filigree It made me think of the award shows you see on television all those beautiful women in shining dresses Devore Yes I said again cautiously Max Devore We dont see him in here too often Audrey had said I had taken that for Yankee wit but apparently shed been serious Wonders never ceased Okay what next I was at a total loss for conversational gambits I thought of asking him how hed gotten my number which was unlisted but what would be the point When you were worth over half a billion dollars  if this really was the Max Devore I was talking to  you could get any old unlisted number you wanted I settled for saying yes again this time without the little uptilt at the end Another silence followed When I broke it and began asking questions he would be in charge of the conversation    if we could be said to be having a conversation at that point A good gambit but I had the advantage of my long association with Harold Oblowski to fall back on  Harold master of the pregnant pause I sat tight cunning little cordless phone to my ear and watched the show in the west Red bursting into blue green into gold unseen women walked the clouds in glowing awardshow evening dresses I understand you met my daughterinlaw today he said at last He sounded annoyed I may have done I said trying not to sound surprised May I ask why youre calling Mr Devore I understand there was an incident White lights danced in the sky  they could have been exploding spacecraft Then trailing after the bangs Ive discovered the secret of time travel I thought Its an auditory phenomenon My hand was holding the phone far too tightly and I made it relax Maxwell Devore Half a billion dollars Not in Palm Springs as I had supposed but close  right here on the TR if the characteristic underhum on the line could be trusted Im concerned for my granddaughter His voice was raspier than ever He was angry and it showed  this was a man who hadnt had to conceal his emotions in a lot of years I understand my daughterinlaws attention wandered again It wanders often Now half a dozen colored starbursts lit the night blooming like flowers in an old Disney nature film I could imagine the crowds gathered on Castle View sitting crosslegged on their blankets eating ice cream cones and drinking beer and all going Oooooh at the same time Thats what makes any successful work of art I thinkeverybody goes Oooooh at the same time Youre scared of this guy arent you Jo asked Okay maybe youre right to be scared A man who feels he can be angry whenever he wants to at whoever he wants to    thats a man who can be dangerous Then Matties voice Mr Noonan Im not a bad mother Nothing like this has ever happened to me before Of course thats what most bad mothers say in such circumstances I imagined    but I had believed her Also goddammit my number was unlisted I had been sitting here with a soda watching the fireworks bothering nobody and this guy had  Mr Devore I dont have any idea what   Dont give me that with all due respect dont give me that Mr Noonan you were seen talking to them He sounded as I imagine Joe Mccarthy sounded to those poor schmucks who ended up being branded dirty commies when they came before his committee Be careful Mike Jo said Beware of Maxwells silver hammer I did see and speak to a woman and a little girl this morning I said I presume theyre the ones youre talking about No you saw a toddler walking on the road alone he said And then you saw a woman chasing after her My daughterinlaw in that old thing she drives The child could have been run down Why are you protecting that young woman Mr Noonan Did she promise you something Youre certainly doing the child no favors I can tell you that much She promised to take me back to her trailer and then take me around the world I thought of saying She promised to keep her mouth open the whole time if Id keep mine shut  is that what you want to hear Yes Jo said Very likely that is what he wants to hear Very likely what he wants to believe Dont let him provoke you into a burst of your sophomore sarcasm Mike  you could regret it Why was I bothering to protect Mattie Devore anyway I didnt know Didnt have the slightest idea of what I might be getting into here for that matter I only knew that she had looked tired and the child hadnt been bruised or frightened or sullen There was a car An old Jeep Thats more like it Satisfaction And sharp interest Greed almost What did   I guess I assumed they came in the car together I said There was a certain giddy pleasure in discovering my capacity for invention had not deserted me  I felt like a pitcher who can no longer do it in front of a crowd but who can still throw a pretty good slider in the old back yard The little girl might have had some daisies All the careful qualifications as if I were testifying in court instead of sitting on my deck Harold would have been proud Well no Harold would have been horrified that I was having such a conversation at all I think I assumed they were picking wildflowers My memory of the incident isnt all that clear unfortunately Im a writer Mr Devore and when Im driving I often drift off into my own private   Youre lying The anger was right out in the open now bright and pulsing like a boil As I had suspected it hadnt taken much effort to escort this guy past the social niceties Mr Devore The computer Devore I assume You assume correctly Jo always grew cooler in tone and expression as her not inconsiderable temper grew hotter Now I heard myself emulating her in a way that was frankly eerie Mr Devore Im not accustomed to being called in the evening by men I dont know nor do I intend to prolong the conversation when a man who does so calls me a liar Good evening sir If everything was fine then why did you stop Ive been away from the TR for some time and I wanted to know if the Village Cafe was still open Oh by the way  I dont know where you got my telephone number but I know where you can put it Good night I broke the connection with my thumb and then just looked at the phone as if I had never seen such a gadget in my life The hand holding it was trembling My heart was beating hard I could feel it in my neck and wrists as well as my chest I wondered if I could have told Devore to stick my phone number up his ass if I hadnt had a few million rattling around in the bank myself The Battle of the Titans dear Jo said in her cool voice And all over a teenage girl in a trailer She didnt even have any breasts to speak of I laughed out loud War of the Titans Hardly Some old robber baron from the turn of the century had said These days a man with a million dollars thinks hes rich Devore would likely have the same opinion of me and in the wider scheme of things he would be right Now the western sky was alight with unnatural pulsing color It was the finale What was that all about I asked No answer only a loon calling across the lake Protesting all the unaccustomed noise in the sky as likely as not I got up went inside and put the phone back in its charging cradle realizing as I did that I was expecting it to ring again expecting Devore to start spouting movie cliches If you get in my way Ill and Im warning you friend not to and Let me give you a piece of good advice before you The phone didnt ring I poured the rest of my soda down my gullet which was understandably dry and decided to go to bed At least there hadnt been any weeping and wailing out there on the deck Devore had pulled me out of myself In a weird way I was grateful to him I went into the north bedroom undressed and lay down I thought about the little girl Kyra and the mother who could have been her older sister Devore was pissed at Mattie that much was clear and if I was a financial nonentity to the guy what must she be to him And what kind of resources would she have if he had taken against her That was a pretty nasty thought actually and it was the one I fell asleep on I got up three hours later to eliminate the can of soda I had unwisely downed before retiring and as I stood before the bowl pissing with one eye open I heard the sobbing again A child somewhere in the dark lost and frightened    or perhaps just pretending to be lost and frightened Dont I said I was standing naked before the toilet bowl my back alive with gooseflesh Please dont start up with this shit its scary The crying dwindled as it had before seeming to diminish like something carried down a tunnel I went back to bed turned on my side and closed my eyes It was a dream I said Just another Manderley dream I knew better but I also knew I was going back to sleep and right then that seemed like the important thing As I drifted off I thought in a voice that was purely my own She is alive Sara is alive And I understood something too she belonged to me I had reclaimed her For good or ill I had come home At nine oclock the following morning I filled a squeezebottle with grapefruit juice and set out for a good long walk south along The Street The day was bright and already hot It was also silent the kind of silence you experience only after a Saturday holiday I think one composed of equal parts holiness and hangover I could see two or three fishermen parked far out on the lake but not a single power boat burred not a single gaggle of kids shouted and splashed I passed half a dozen cottages on the slope above me and although all of them were likely inhabited at this time of year the only signs of life I saw were bathing suits hung over the deck rail at the Passendales and a halfdeflated fluorescentgreen seahorse on the Batchelders stub of a dock But did the Passendales little gray cottage still belong to the Passendales Did the Batchelders amusing circular summercamp with its Cinerama picturewindow pointing at the lake and the mountains beyond still belong to the Batchelders No way of telling of course Four years can bring a lot of changes I walked and made no effort to think  an old trick from my writing days Work your body rest your mind let the boys in the basement do their jobs I made my way past camps where Jo and I had once had drinks and barbecues and attended the occasional cardparty I soaked up the silence like a sponge I drank my juice I armed sweat off my forehead and I waited to see what thoughts might come The first was an odd realization that the crying child in the night seemed somehow more real than the call from Max Devore Had I actually been phoned by a rich and obviously badtempered technomogul on my first full evening back on the TR Had said mogul actually called me a liar at one point I was considering the tale I had told but that was beside the point I knew it had happened but it was actually easier to believe in The Ghost of Dark Score Lake known around some campfires as The Mysterious Crying Kiddie My next thought  this was just before I finished my juice  was that I should call Mattie Devore and tell her what had happened I decided it was a natural impulse but probably a bad idea I was too old to believe in such simplicities as The Damsel in Distress Versus The Wicked Stepfather    or in this case FatherinLaw I had my own fish to fry this summer and I didnt want to complicate my job by getting into a potentially ugly dispute between Mr Computer and Ms Doublewide Devore had rubbed my fur the wrong way  and vigorously  but that probably wasnt personal only something he did as a matter of course Hey some guys snap brastraps Did I want to get in his face on this No I did not I had saved Little Miss Red Sox I had gotten myself an inadvertent feel of Moms small but pleasantly firm breast I had learned that Kyra was Greek for ladylike Any more than that would be gluttony by God I stopped at that point feet as well as brain realizing Id walked all the way to Warringtons a vast barnboard structure which locals sometimes called the country club It was sort of  there was a sixhole golf course a stable and riding trails a restaurant a bar and lodging for perhaps three dozen in the main building and the eight or nine satellite cabins There was even a twolane bowling alley although you and your competition had to take turns setting up the pins Warringtons had been built around the beginning of World War I That made it younger than Sara Laughs but not by much A long dock led out to a smaller building called The Sunset Bar It was there that Warringtons summer guests would gather for drinks at the end of the day and some for Bloody Marys at the beginning And when I glanced out that way I realized I was no longer alone There was a woman standing on the porch to the left of the floating bars door watching me She gave me a pretty good jump My nerves werent in their best condition right then and that probably had something to do with it    but I think she would have given me a jump in any case Part of it was her stillness Part was her extraordinary thinness Most of it was her face Have you ever seen that Edvard Munch drawing The Cry Well if you imagine that screaming face at rest mouth closed and eyes watchful youll have a pretty good image of the woman standing at the end of the dock with one longfingered hand resting on the rail Although I must tell you that my first thought was not Edvard Munch but Mrs Danvers She looked about seventy and was wearing black shorts over a black tank bathing suit The combination looked strangely formal a variation on the everpopular little black cocktail dress Her skin was creamwhite except above her nearly flat bosom and along her bony shoulders There it swam with large brown agespots Her face was a wedge featuring prominent skulllike cheekbones and an unlined lamp of brow Beneath that bulge her eyes were lost in sockets of shadow White hair hung scant and lank around her ears and down to the prominent shelf of her jaw God shes thin I thought Shes nothing but a bag of  A shudder twisted through me at that It was a strong one as if someone were spinning a wire in my flesh I didnt want her to notice it  what a way to start a summer day by revolting a guy so badly that he stood there shaking and grimacing in front of you  so I raised my hand and waved I tried to smile as well Hello there lady standing out by the floating bar Hello there you old bag of bones you scared the living shit out of me but it doesnt take much these days and I forgive you How the fuck ya doin I wondered if my smile looked as much like a grimace to her as it felt to me She didnt wave back Feeling quite a bit like a fool  THERES NO VILLAGE IDIOT HERE WE ALL TAKE TURNS  I ended my wave in a kind of halfassed salute and headed back the way Id come Five steps and I had to look over my shoulder the sensation of her watching me was so strong it was like a hand pressing between my shoulderblades The dock where shed been was completely deserted I squinted my eyes at first sure she must have just retreated deeper into the shadow thrown by the little boozehaus but she was gone As if she had been a ghost herself She stepped into the bar hon Jo said You know that dont you I mean    you do know it right Right right I murmured setting off north along The Street toward home Of course I do Where else Except it didnt seem to me that there had been time it didnt seem to me that she could have stepped in even in her bare feet without me hearing her Not on such a quiet morning Jo again Perhaps shes stealthy Yes I murmured I did a lot of talking out loud before that summer was over Yes perhaps she is Perhaps shes stealthy Sure Like Mrs Danvers I stopped again and looked back but the rightofway path had followed the lake around a little bit of curve and I could no longer see either Warringtons or The Sunset Bar And really I thought that was just as well On my way back I tried to list the oddities which had preceded and then surrounded my return to Sara Laughs the repeating dreams the sunflowers the radiostation sticker the weeping in the night I supposed that my encounter with Mattie and Kyra plus the followup phonecall from Mr Pixel Easel also qualified as passing strange    but not in the same way as a child you heard sobbing in the night And what about the fact that we had been in Derry instead of on Dark Score when Johanna died Did that qualify for the list I didnt know I couldnt even remember why that was In the fall and winter of  Id been fiddling with a screenplay for The RedShirt Man In February of  I got going on All the Way from the Top and that absorbed most of my attention Besides deciding to go west to the TR west to Sara    That was Jos job I told the day and as soon as I heard the words I understood how true they were Wed both loved the old girl but saying Hey Irish lets get our asses over to the TR for a few days had been Jos job She might say it any time    except in the year before her death she hadnt said it once And I had never thought to say it for her Had somehow forgotten all about Sara Laughs it seemed even when summer came around Was it possible to be that absorbed in a writing project It didnt seem likely    but what other explanation was there Something was very wrong with this picture but I didnt know what it was Not from nothin That made me think of Sara Tidwell and the lyrics to one of her songs She had never been recorded but I owned the Blind Lemon Jefferson version of this particular tune One verse went It aint nuthin but a barndance sugar It aint nuthin but a roundandround Let me kiss you on your sweet lips sugar You the good thing that I found I loved that song and had always wondered how it would have sounded coming out of a womans mouth instead of from that whiskeyvoiced old troubadour Out of Sara Tidwells mouth I bet she sang sweet And boy I bet she could swing it I had gotten back to my own place again I looked around saw no one in the immediate vicinity although I could now hear the days first skiboat burring away downwater stripped to my underpants and swam out to the float I didnt climb it only lay beside it holding onto the ladder with one hand and lazily kicking my feet It was nice enough but what was I going to do with the rest of the day I decided to spend it cleaning my work area on the second floor When that was done maybe Id go out and look around in Jos studio If I didnt lose my courage that was I swam back kicking easily along raising my head in and out of water which flowed along my body like cool silk I felt like an otter I was most of the way to the shore when I raised my dripping face and saw a woman standing on The Street watching me She was as thin as the one Id seen down at Warringtons    but this one was green Green and pointing north along the path like a dryad in some old legend I gasped swallowed water coughed it back out I stood up in chestdeep water and wiped my streaming eyes Then I laughed albeit a little doubtfully The woman was green because she was a birch growing a little to the north of where my set of railroadtie steps ended at The Street And even with my eyes clear of water there was something creepy about how the leaves around the ivorystreakedwithblack trunk almost made a peering face The air was perfectly still and so the face was perfectly still as still as the face of the woman in the black shorts and bathing suit had been but on a breezy day it would seem to smile or frown    or perhaps to laugh Behind it there grew a sickly pine One bare branch jutted off to the north It was this I had mistaken for a skinny arm and a bony pointing hand It wasnt the first time Id spooked myself like that I see things thats all Write enough stories and every shadow on the floor looks like a footprint every line in the dirt like a secret message Which did not of course ease the task of deciding what was really peculiar at Sara Laughs and what was peculiar only because my mind was peculiar I glanced around saw I still had this part of the lake to myself although not for much longer the beebuzz of the first power boat had been joined by a second and third and stripped off my soggy underpants I wrung them out put them on top of my shorts and teeshirt and walked naked up the railroadtie steps with my clothes held against my chest I pretended I was Bunter bringing breakfast and the morning paper to Lord Peter Wimsey By the time I got back inside the house I was grinning like a fool The second floor was stifling in spite of the open windows and I saw why as soon as I got to the top of the stairs Jo and I had shared space up here she on the left only a little room really just a cubby which was all she needed with the studio north of the house me on the right At the far end of the hall was the grilled snout of the monster airconditioning unit wed bought the year after we bought the lodge Looking at it I realized I had missed its characteristic hum without even being aware of it There was a sign taped to it which said Mr Noonan Broken Blows hot air when you turn it on  sounds full of broken glass Dean says the part it needs is promised from Western Auto in Castle Rock Ill believe it when I see it B Meserve I grinned at that last  it was Mrs M right down to the ground  and then I tried the switch Machinery often responds favorably when it senses a penisequipped human in the vicinity Jo used to claim but not this time I listened to the air conditioner grind for five seconds or so then snapped it off Damn thing shit the bed as TR folks like to say And until it was fixed I wouldnt even be doing crossword puzzles up here I looked in my office just the same as curious about what I might feel as about what I might find The answer was next to nothing There was the desk where I had finished The RedShirt Man thus proving to myself that the first time wasnt a fluke there was the photo of Richard Nixon arms raised flashing the double VforVictory sign with the caption WOULD YOU BUY A USED CAR FROM THIS MAN running beneath there was the rag rug Jo had hooked for me a winter or two before she had discovered the wonderful world of afghans and pretty much gave up hooking It wasnt quite the office of a stranger but every item most of all the weirdly empty surface of the desk said that it was the workspace of an earliergeneration Mike Noonan Mens lives I had read once are usually defined by two primary forces work and marriage In my life the marriage was over and the career on what appeared to be permanent hiatus Given that it didnt seem strange to me that now the space where Id spent so many days usually in a state of real happiness as I made up various imaginary lives seemed to mean nothing It was like looking at the office of an employee who had been fired    or who had died suddenly I started to leave then had an idea The filing cabinet in the corner was crammed with papers  bank statements most eight or ten years out of date correspondence mostly never answered a few story fragmentsbut I didnt find what I was looking for I moved on to the closet where the temperature had to be at least a hundred and ten degrees and in a cardboard box which Mrs M had marked GADGETS I unearthed it  a Sanyo MemoScriber Debra Weinstock gave me at the conclusion of our work on the first of the Putnam books It could be set to turn itself on when you started to talk it dropped into its PAUSE mode when you stopped to think I never asked Debra if the thing just caught her eye and she thought Why Ill bet any selfrespecting popular novelist would enjoy owning one of these babies or if it was something a little more specific    some sort of hint perhaps Verbalize those little faxes from your subconscious while theyre still fresh Noonan I hadnt known then and didnt now But I had it a genuine proquality dictatingmachine and there were at least a dozen cassette tapes in my car home dubs Id made to listen to while driving I would insert one in the MemoScriber tonight slide the volume control as high as it would go and put the machine in its DICTATE mode Then if the noise Id heard at least twice now repeated itself I would have it on tape I could play it for Bill Dean and ask him what he thought it was What if I hear the sobbing child tonight and the machine never kicks on Well then Ill know something else I told the empty sunlit office I was standing there in the doorway with the MemoScriber under my arm looking at the empty desk and sweating like a pig Or at least suspect it Jos nook across the hall made my office seem crowded and homey by comparison Never overfull it was now nothing but a square roomshaped space The rug was gone her photos were gone even the desk was gone This looked like a doityourself project which had been abandoned after ninety percent of the work had been done Jo had been scrubbed out of it  scraped out of it  and I felt a moments unreasonable anger at Brenda Meserve I thought of what my mother usually said when Id done something on my own initiative of which she disapproved You took a little too much on yself didnt you That was my feeling about Jos little bit of office that in emptying it to the walls this way Mrs Meserve had taken a little too much on herself Maybe it wasnt Mrs M who cleaned it out the UFO voice said Maybe Jo did it herself Ever think of that sport Thats stupid I said Why would she I hardly think she had a premonition of her own death Considering shed just bought   But I didnt want to say it Not out loud It seemed like a bad idea somehow I turned to leave the room and a sudden sigh of cool air amazing in that heat rushed past the sides of my face Not my body just my face It was the most extraordinary sensation like hands patting briefly but gently at my cheeks and forehead At the same time there was a sighing in my ears    except thats not quite right It was a susurrus that went past my ears like a whispered message spoken in a hurry I turned expecting to see the curtains over the rooms window in motion    but they hung perfectly straight Jo I said and hearing her name made me shiver so violently that I almost dropped the MemoScriber Jo was that you Nothing No phantom hands patting my skin no motion from the curtains    which there certainly would have been if there had been an actual draft All was quiet There was only a tall man with a sweaty face and a taperecorder under his arm standing in the doorway of a bare room    but that was when I first began to really believe that I wasnt alone in Sara Laughs So what I asked myself Even if it should be true so what Ghosts cant hurt anyone Thats what I thought then When I visited Jos studio her airconditioned studio after lunch I felt quite a lot better about Brenda Meserve  she hadnt taken too much on herself after all The few items I especially remembered from Jos little office  the framed square of her first afghan the green rag rug her framed poster depicting the wildflowers of Maine  had been put out here along with almost everything else I remembered It was as if Mrs M had sent a message  I cant ease your pain or shorten your sadness and I cant prevent the wounds that coming back here may reopen but I can put all the stuff that may hurt you in one place so you wont be stumbling over it unexpected or unprepared I can do that much Out here were no bare walls out here the walls jostled with my wifes spirit and creativity There were knitted things some serious many whimsical batik squares rag dolls popping out of what she called my baby collages an abstract desert painting made from strips of yellow black and orange silk her flower photographs even on top of her bookshelf what appeared to be a constructioninprogress a head of Sara Laughs herself It was made out of toothpicks and lollipop sticks In one corner was her little loom and a wooden cabinet with a sign reading JOS KNITTING STUFF NO TRESPASSING hung over the pullknob In another was the banjo she had tried to learn and then given up on saying it hurt her fingers too much In a third was a kayak paddle and a pair of Rollerblades with scuffed toes and little purple pompoms on the tips of the laces The thing which caught and held my eye was sitting on the old rolltop desk in the center of the room During the many good summers falls and winter weekends we had spent here that desktop would have been littered with spools of thread skeins of yarn pincushions sketches maybe a book about the Spanish Civil War or famous American dogs Johanna could be aggravating at least to me because she imposed no real system or order on what she did She could also be daunting even overwhelming at times She was a brilliant scatterbrain and her desk had always reflected that But not now It was possible to think that Mrs M had cleared the litter from the top of it and plunked down what was now there but impossible to believe Why would she It made no sense The object was covered with a gray plastic hood I reached out to touch it and my hand faltered an inch or two short as a memory of an old dream give me that its my dustcatcher slipped across my mind much as that queer draft ad slipped across my face Then it was gone and I pulled the plastic over off Underneath it was my old green IBM Selectric which I hadnt seen or thought of in years I leaned closer knowing that the typewriter ball would be Courier  my old favorite  even before I saw it What in Gods name was my old typewriter doing out here Johanna painted although not very well she took photographs very good ones indeed and sometimes sold them she knitted she crocheted she wove and dyed cloth she could play eight or ten basic chords on the guitar She could write of course most English majors can which is why they become English majors Did she demonstrate any blazing degree of literary creativity No After a few experiments with poetry as an undergrad she gave up that particular branch of the arts as a bad job You write for both of us Mike she had said once Thats all yours Ill just take a little taste of everything else Given the quality of her poems as opposed to the quality of her silks photographs and knitted art I thought that was probably wise But here was my old IBM Why Letters I said She found it down cellar or something and rescued it to write letters on Except that wasnt Jo She showed me most of her letters often urging me to write little postscripts of my own guilttripping me with that old saying about how the shoemakers kids always go barefoot and the writers friends would never hear from him if it werent for Alexander Graham Bell she was apt to add I hadnt seen a typed personal letter from my wife in all the time wed been married  if nothing else she would have considered it shitty etiquette She could type producing mistakefree business letters slowly yet methodically but she always used my desktop computer or her own Powerbook for those chores What were you up to hon I asked then began to investigate her desk drawers Brenda Meserve had made an effort with these but Jos fundamental nature had defeated her Surface order spools of thread segregated by color for instance quickly gave way to Jos old dear jumble I found enough of her in those drawers to hurt my heart with a hundred unexpected memories but I found no paperwork which had been typed on my old IBM with or without the Courier ball Not so much as a single page When I was finished with my hunt I leaned back in my chair her chair and looked at the little framed photo on her desk one I couldnt remember ever having seen before Jo had most likely printed it herself the original might have come out of some locals attic and then handtinted the result The final product looked like a wanted poster colorized by Ted Turner I picked it up and ran the ball of my thumb over the glass facing bemused Sara Tidwell the turnofthecentury blues shouter whose last known port of call had been right here in TR When she and her folks  some of them friends most of them relatives  had left the TR they had gone on to Castle Rock for a little while    then had simply disappeared like a cloud over the horizon or mist on a summer morning She was smiling just a little in the picture but the smile was hard to read Her eyes were halfclosed The string of her guitar  not a strap but a string  was visible over one shoulder In the background I could see a black man wearing a derby at a killer angle one thing about musicians they really know how to wear hats and standing beside what appeared to be a washtub bass Jo had tinted Saras skin to a cafaulait shade maybe based on other pictures shed seen there are quite a few knocking around most showing Sara with her head thrown back and her hair hanging almost to her waist as she bellows out her famous carefree yell of a laugh although none would have been in color Not at the turn of the century Sara Tidwell hadnt just left her mark in old photographs either I recalled Dickie Brooks owner of the AllPurpose Garage once telling me that his father claimed to have won a teddybear at the Castle County Fairs shootingpitch and to have given it to Sara Tidwell She had rewarded him Dickie said with a kiss According to Dickie the old man never forgot it said it was the best kiss of his life    although I doubt if he said it in his wifes hearing In this photo she was only smiling Sara Tidwell known as Sara Laughs Never recorded but her songs had lived just the same One of them Walk Me Baby bears a remarkable resemblance to Walk This Way by Aerosmith Today the lady would be known as an AfricanAmerican In  when Johanna and I bought the lodge and consequently got interested in her she would have been known as a Black In her own time she would have been called a Negress or a darkie or possibly an octoroon And a nigger of course There would have been plenty of folks free with that one And did I believe that she had kissed Dickie Brookss father  a white man  in front of half of Castle County No I did not Still who could say for sure No one That was the entrancing thing about the past It aint nuthin but a barndance sugar I sang putting the picture back on the desk It aint nuthin but a roundandround I picked up the typewriter cover then decided to leave it off As I stood my eyes went back to Sara standing there with her eyes closed and the string which served her as a guitar strap visible over one shoulder Something in her face and smile had always struck me as familiar and suddenly it came to me She looked oddly like Robert Johnson whose primitive licks hid behind the chords of almost every Led Zeppelin and Yardbirds song ever recorded Who according to the legend had gone down to the crossroads and sold his soul to Satan for seven years of fast living hightension liquor and streetlife babies And for a jukejoint brand of immortality of course Which he had gotten Robert Johnson supposedly poisoned over a woman In the late afternoon I went down to the store and saw a goodlooking piece of flounder in the coldcase It looked like supper to me I bought a bottle of white wine to go with it and while I was waiting my turn at the cash register a trembling old mans voice spoke up behind me See you made a new friend yesty The Yankee accent was so thick that it sounded almost like a joke    except the accent itself is only part of it mostly Ive come to believe its that singsong tone  real Mainers all sound like auctioneers I turned and saw the geezer who had been standing out on the garage tarmac the day before watching along with Dickie Brooks as I got to know Kyra Mattie and Scoutie He still had the goldheaded cane and I now recognized it Sometime in the s the Boston Post had donated one of those canes to every county in the New England states They were given to the oldest residents and passed along from old fart to old fart And the joke of it was that the Post had gone toesup years ago Actually two new friends I replied trying to dredge up his name I couldnt but I remembered him from when Jo had been alive holding down one of the overstuffed chairs in Dickies waiting room discussing weather and politics politics and weather as the hammers whanged and the aircompressor chugged A regular And if something happened out there on Highway  eyeGod he was there to see it I hear Mattie Devore can be quite a dear he said heah Devoah deeah  and one of his crusty eyelids drooped I have seen a fair number of salacious winks in my time but none that was a patch on the one tipped me by that old man with the goldheaded cane I felt a strong urge to knock his waxy beak of a nose off The sound of it parting company from his face would be like the crack of a dead branch broken over a bent knee Do you hear a lot oldtimer I asked Oh ayuh he said His lips  dark as strips of liver  parted in a grin His gums swarmed with white patches He had a couple of yellow teeth still planted in the top one and a couple more on the bottom And she gut that little one  cunnin she is Ayuh Cunnin as a cat arunnin I agreed He blinked at me a little surprised to hear such an old one out of my presumably newfangled mouth and then that reprehensible grin widened Her dont mind her though he said Baby gut the run of the place dontcha know I became aware  better belated than never  that half a dozen people were watching and listening to us That wasnt my impression I said raising my voice a bit No that wasnt my impression at all He only grinned    that old mans grin that says Oh ayuh deah I know one worth two of that I left the store feeling worried for Mattie Devore Too many people were minding her business it seemed to me When I got home I took my bottle of wine into the kitchen  it could chill while I got the barbecue going out on the deck I reached for the fridge door then paused Perhaps as many as four dozen little magnets had been scattered randomly across the front  vegetables fruits plastic letters and numbers even a good selection of the California Raisins  but they werent random anymore Now they formed a circle on the front of the refrigerator Someone had been in here Someone had come in and    Rearranged the magnets on the fridge If so that was a burglar who needed to do some heavy remedial work I touched one of them  gingerly with just the tip of my finger Then suddenly angry with myself I reached out and spread them again doing it with enough force to knock a couple to the floor I didnt pick them up That night before going to bed I placed the MemoScriber on the table beneath Bunter the Great Stuffed Moose turning it on and putting it in the DICTATE mode Then I slipped in one of my old homedubbed cassettes zeroed the counter and went to bed where I slept without dreams or other interruption for eight hours The next morning Monday was the sort of day the tourists come to Maine for  the air so sunnyclean that the hills across the lake seemed to be under subtle magnification Mount Washington New Englands highest floated in the farthest distance I put on the coffee then went into the living room whistling All my imaginings of the last few days seemed silly this morning Then the whistle died away The MemoScribers counter set to  when I went to bed was now at  I rewound it hesitated with my finger over the PLAY button told myself in Jos voice not to be a fool and pushed it Oh Mike a voice whispered  mourned almoston the tape and I found myself having to press the heel of one hand to my mouth to hold back a scream It was what I had heard in Jos office when the draft rushed past the sides of my face    only now the words were slowed down just enough for me to understand them Oh Mike it said again There was a faint click The machine had shut down for some length of time And then once more spoken in the living room as I had slept in the north wing Oh Mike Then it was gone Around nine oclock a pickup came down the driveway and parked behind my Chevrolet The truck was new a Dodge Ram so clean and chromeshiny it looked as if the tenday plates had just come off that morning  but it was the same shade of offwhite as the last one and the sign on the drivers door was the one I remembered WILLIAM BILL DEAN CAMP CHECKING CARETAKING LIGHT CARPENTRY plus his telephone number I went out on the back stoop to meet him coffee cup in my hand Mike Bill cried climbing down from behind the wheel Yankee men dont hug  thats a truism you can put right up there with tough guys dont dance and real men dont eat quiche  but Bill pumped my hand almost hard enough to slop coffee from a cup that was threequarters empty and gave me a hearty clap on the back His grin revealed a splendidly blatant set of false teeth  the kind which used to be called Roebuckers because you got them from the catalogue It occurred to me in passing that my ancient interlocutor from the Lakeview General Store could have used a pair It certainly would have improved mealtimes for the nosy old fuck Mike youre a sight for sore eyes Good to see you too I said grinning Nor was it a false grin I felt all right Things with the power to scare the living shit out of you on a thundery midnight in most cases seem only interesting in the bright light of a summer morning Youre looking well my friend It was true Bill was four years older and a little grayer around the edges but otherwise the same Sixtyfive Seventy It didnt matter There was no waxy look of ill health about him and none of the fallingaway in the face principally around the eyes and in the cheeks that I associate with encroaching infirmity Sore you he said letting go of my hand We was all so sorry about Jo Mike Folks in town thought the world of her It was a shock with her so young My wife asked if Id give you her condolences special Jo made her an afghan the year she had the pneumonia and Yvette aint never forgot it Thanks I said and my voice wasnt quite my own for a moment or two It seemed that on the TR my wife was hardly dead at all And thank Yvette too Yuh Everythin okay with the house Othern the air conditioner I mean Buggardly thing Them at the Western Auto promised me that part last week and now theyre saying maybe not until August first Its okay Ive got my Powerbook If I want to use it the kitchen table will do fine for a desk And I would want to use it  so many crosswords so little time Got your hot water okay All thats fine but there is one problem I stopped How did you tell your caretaker you thought your house was haunted Probably there was no good way probably the best thing to do was to go at it headon I had questions but I didnt want just to nibble around the edges of the subject and be coy For one thing Bill would sense it He might have bought his false teeth out of a catalogue but he wasnt stupid Whats on your mind Mike Shoot I dont know how youre going to take this but   He smiled in the way of a man who suddenly understands and held up his hand Guess maybe I know already You do I felt an enormous sense of relief and I could hardly wait to find out what he had experienced in Sara perhaps while checking for dead lightbulbs or making sure the roof was holding the snow all right What did you hear Mostly what Royce Merrill and Dickie Brooks have been telling he said Beyond that I dont know much Me and mothers been in Virginia remember Only got back last night around eight oclock Still its the big topic down to the store For a moment I remained so fixed on Sara Laughs that I had no idea what he was talking about All I could think was that folks were gossiping about the strange noises in my house Then the name Royce Merrill clicked and everything else clicked with it Merrill was the elderly possum with the goldheaded cane and the salacious wink Old FourTeeth My caretaker wasnt talking about ghostly noises he was talking about Mattie Devore Lets get you a cup of coffee I said I need you to tell me what Im stepping in here When we were seated on the deck me with fresh coffee and Bill with a cup of tea Coffee burns me at both ends these days he said I asked him first to tell me the Royce MerrillDickie Brooks version of my encounter with Mattie and Kyra It turned out to be better than I had expected Both old men had seen me standing at the side of the road with the little girl in my arms and they had observed my Chevy parked halfway into the ditch with the driversside door open but apparently neither of them had seen Kyra using the white line of Route  as a tightrope As if to compensate for this however Royce claimed that Mattie had given me a big my hero hug and a kiss on the mouth Did he get the part about how I grabbed her by the ass and slipped her some tongue I asked Bill grinned Royces imagination aint stretched that far since he was fifty or so and that was forty or more year ago I never touched her Well    there had been that moment when the back of my hand went sliding along the curve of her breast but that had been inadvertent whatever the young lady herself might think about it Shite you dont need to tell me that he said But     He said that but the way my mother always had letting it trail off on its own like the tail of some illomened kite But what Youd do well to keep your distance from her he said Shes nice enough  almost a town girl dont you know  but shes trouble He paused No that aint quite fair to her Shes in trouble The old man wants custody of the baby doesnt he Bill set his teacup down on the deck rail and looked at me with his eyebrows raised Reflections from the lake ran up his cheek in ripples giving him an exotic look Howd you know Guesswork but of the educated variety Her fatherinlaw called me Saturday night during the fireworks And while he never came right out and stated his purpose I doubt if Max Devore came all the way back to TR in western Maine to repo his daughterinlaws Jeep and trailer So whats the story Bill For several moments he only looked at me It was almost the look of a man who knows you have contracted a serious disease and isnt sure how much he ought to tell you Being looked at that way made me profoundly uneasy It also made me feel that I might be putting Bill Dean on the spot Devore had roots here after all And as much as Bill might like me I didnt Jo and I were from away It could have been worse  it could have been Massachusetts or New York  but Derry although in Maine was still away Bill I could use a little navigational help if you   You want to stay out of his way he said His easy smile was gone The mans mad For a moment I thought Bill only meant Devore was pissed off at me and then I took another look at his face No I decided he didnt mean pissed off he had used the word mad in the most literal way Mad how I asked Mad like Charles Manson Like Hannibal Lecter How Say like Howard Hughes he said Ever read any of the stories about him The lengths hed go to to get the things he wanted It didnt matter if it was a special kind of hot dog they only sold in LA or an airplane designer he wanted to steal from Lockheed or McdonnellDouglas he had to have what he wanted and he wouldnt rest until it was under his hand Devore is the same way He always was  even as a boy he was willful according to the stories you hear in town My own dad had one he used to tell He said little Max Devore broke into Scant Larribees tackshed one winter because he wanted the Flexible Flyer Scant give his boy Scooter for Christmas Back around  this would have been Devore cut both his hands on broken glass Dad said but he got the sled They found him near midnight sliding down Sugar Maple Hill holding his hands up to his chest when he went down Hed bled all over his mittens and his snowsuit Theres other stories youll hear about Maxie Devore as a kid  if you ask youll hear fifty different ones  and some may even be true That one about the sled is true though Id bet the farm on it Because my father didnt lie It was against his religion Baptist Nosir Yankee  was many moons ago Bill Sometimes people change Ayuh but mostly they dont I havent seen Devore since he come back and moved into Warringtons so I cant say for sure but Ive heard things that make me think that if he has changed its for the worse He didnt come all the way across the country cause he wanted a vacation He wants the kid To him shes just another version of Scooter Larribees Flexible Flyer And my strong advice to you is that you dont want to be the windowglass between him and her I sipped my coffee and looked out at the lake Bill gave me time to think scraping one of his workboots across a splatter of birdshit on the boards while I did it Crowshit I reckoned only crows crap in such long and exuberant splatters One thing seemed absolutely sure Mattie Devore was roughly nine miles up Shit Creek with no paddle Im not the cynic I was at twenty  is anyone  but I wasnt naive enough or idealistic enough to believe the law would protect Ms Doublewide against Mr Computer    not if Mr Computer decided to play dirty As a boy hed taken the sled he wanted and gone sliding by himself at midnight bleeding hands not a concern And as a man An old man who had been getting every sled he wanted for the last forty years or so Whats the story with Mattie Bill Tell me It didnt take him long Country stories are by and large simple stories Which isnt to say theyre not often interesting Mattie Devore had started life as Mattie Stanchfield not quite from the TR but from just over the line in Motton Her father had been a logger her mother a home beautician which made it in a ghastly way the perfect country marriage There were three kids When Dave Stanchfield missed a curve over in Lovell and drove a fully loaded pulptruck into Kewadin Pond his widow kinda lost heart as they say She died soon after There had been no insurance other than what Stanchfield had been obliged to carry on his Jimmy and his skidder Talk about your Brothers Grimm huh Subtract the FisherPrice toys behind the house the two pole hairdryers in the basement beauty salon the old rustbucket Toyota in the driveway and you were right there Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her three children Mattie is the princess of the piece  poor but beautiful that she was beautiful I could personally testify Now enter the prince In this case hes a gangly stuttering redhead named Lance Devore The child of Max Devores sunset years When Lance met Mattie he was twentyone She had just turned seventeen The meeting took place at Warringtons where Mattie had landed a summer job as a waitress Lance Devore was staying across the lake on the Upper Bay but on Tuesday nights there were pickup softball games at Warringtons the townies against the summer folks and he usually canoed across to play Softball is a great thing for the Lance Devores of the world when youre standing at the plate with a bat in your hands it doesnt matter if youre gangly And it sure doesnt matter if you stutter He confused em quite considerable over to Warringtons Bill said They didnt know which team he belonged on  the Locals or the Aways Lance didnt care either side was fine with him Some weeks hed play for one some weeks tother Either one was more than happy to have him too as he could hit a ton and field like an angel Theyd put him at first base a lot because he was tall but he was really wasted there At second or shortstop    my Hed jump and twirl around like that guy Noriega You might mean Nureyev I said He shrugged Point is he was somethin to see And folks liked him He fit in Its mostly young folks that play you know and to them its how you do not who you are Besides a lot of em dont know Max Devore from a hole in the ground Unless they read The Wall Street Journal and the computer magazines I said In those you run across the name Devore about as often as you run across the name of God in the Bible No foolin Well I guess that in the computer magazines God is more often spelled Gates but you know what I mean I spose But even so its been sixtyfive years since Max Devore spent any real time on the TR You know what happened when he left dont you No why would I He looked at me surprised Then a kind of veil seemed to fall over his eyes He blinked and it cleared Tell you another time  it aint no secret  but I need to be over to the Harrimans by eleven to check their sumppump Dont want to get sidetracked Point I was tryin to make is just this Lance Devore was accepted as a nice young fella who could hit a softball three hundred and fifty feet into the trees if he struck it just right There was no one old enough to hold his old man against him  not at Warringtons on Tuesday nights there wasnt  and no one held it against him that his family had dough either Hell there are lots of wealthy people here in the summer You know that None worth as much as Max Devore but being rich is only a matter of degree That wasnt true and I had just enough money to know it Wealth is like the Richter scaleonce you pass a certain point the jumps from one level to the next arent double or triple but some amazing and ruinous multiple you dont even want to think about Fitzgerald had it straight although I guess he didnt believe his own insight the very rich are different from you and me I thought of telling Bill that and decided to keep my mouth shut He had a sumppump to fix Kyras parents met over a keg of beer stuck in a mudhole Mattie was running the usual Tuesdaynight keg out to the softball field from the main building on a handcart Shed gotten it most of the way from the restaurant wing with no trouble but there had been heavy rain earlier in the week and the cart finally bogged down in a soft spot Lances team was up and Lance was sitting at the end of the bench waiting his turn to hit He saw the girl in the white shorts and blue Warringtons polo shirt struggling with the bogged handcart and got up to help her Three weeks later they were inseparable and Mattie was pregnant ten weeks later they were married thirtyseven months later Lance Devore was in a coffin done with softball and cold beer on a summer evening done with what he called woodsing done with fatherhood done with love for the beautiful princess Just another early finish hold the happilyeverafter Bill Dean didnt describe their meeting in any detail he only said They met at the field  she was runnin out the beer and he helped her out of a boghole when she got her handcart stuck Mattie never said much about that part of it so I dont know much Except I do    and although some of the details might be wrong Id bet you a dollar to a hundred  got most of them right That was my summer for knowing things I had no business knowing Its hot for one thing   is the hottest summer of the decade and July is the hottest month of the summer President Clinton is being upstaged by Newt and the Republicans Folks are saying old Slick Willie may not even run for a second term Boris Yeltsin is reputed to be either dying of heart disease or in a dryout clinic The Red Sox are looking better than they have any right to In Derry Johanna Arlen Noonan is maybe starting to feel a little whoopsy in the morning If so she does not speak of it to her husband I see Mattie in her blue polo shirt with her name sewn in white script above her left breast Her white shorts make a pleasing contrast to her tanned legs I also see her wearing a blue gimme cap with the red W for Warringtons above the long bill Her pretty darkblonde hair is pulled through the hole at the back of the cap and falls to the collar of her shirt I see her trying to yank the handcart out of the mud without upsetting the keg of beer Her head is down the shadow thrown by the bill of the cap obscures all of her face but her mouth and small set chin Luhlet mme hhhelp Lance says and she looks up The shadow cast by the caps bill falls away he sees her big blue eyes  the ones shell pass on to their daughter One look into those eyes and the war is over without a single shot fired he belongs to her as surely as any young man ever belonged to any young woman The rest as they say around here was just courtin The old man had three children but Lance was the only one he seemed to care about Daughters craziern a shithouse mouse Bill said matteroffactly In some laughin academy in California Think I heard she caught her a cancer too The fact that Lance had no interest in computers and software actually seemed to please his father He had another son who was capable of running the business In another way however Lance Devores older halfbrother wasnt capable at all there would be no grandchildren from that one Rumpwrangler Bill said Understand theres a lot of that going around out there in California There was a fair amount of it going around on the TR too I imagined but thought it not my place to offer sexual instruction to my caretaker Lance Devore had been attending Reed College in Oregon majoring in forestry  the kind of guy who falls in love with green flannel pants red suspenders and the sight of condors at dawn A Brothers Grimm woodcutter in fact once you got past the academic jargon In the summer between his junior and senior years his father had summoned him to the family compound in Palm Springs and had presented him with a boxy lawyers suitcase crammed with maps aerial photos and legal papers These had little order that Lance could see but I doubt that he cared Imagine a comicbook collector given a crate crammed with rare old copies of Donald Duck Imagine a movie collector given the rough cut of a neverreleased film starring Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe Then imagine this avid young forester realizing that his father owned not just acres or square miles in the vast unincorporated forests of western Maine but entire realms Although Max Devore had left the TR in  hed kept a lively interest in the area where hed grown up subscribing to area newspapers and getting magazines such as Down East and the Maine Times In the early eighties he had begun to buy long columns of land just east of the MaineNew Hampshire border God knew there had been plenty for sale the paper companies which owned most of it had fallen into a recessionary pit and many had become convinced that their New England holdings and operations would be the best place to begin retrenching So this land stolen from the Indians and clearcut ruthlessly in the twenties and fifties came into Max Devores hands He might have bought it just because it was there a good bargain he could afford to take advantage of He might have bought it as a way of demonstrating to himself that he had really survived his childhood had in point of fact triumphed over it Or he might have bought it as a toy for his beloved younger son In the years when Devore was making his major land purchases in western Maine Lance would have been just a kid    but old enough for a perceptive father to see where his interests were tending Devore asked Lance to spend the summer of  surveying purchases which were for the most part already ten years old He wanted the boy to put the paperwork in order but he wanted more than that  he wanted Lance to make sense of it It wasnt a landuse recommendation he was looking for exactly although I guess he would have listened if Lance had wanted to make one he simply wanted a sense of what he had purchased Would Lance take a summer in western Maine trying to find out what his sense of it was At a salary of two or three thousand dollars a month I imagine Lances reply was a more polite version of Buddy Jellisons Does a crow shit in the pine tops The kid arrived in June of  and set up shop in a tent on the far side of Dark Score Lake He was due back at Reed in late August Instead though he decided to take a years leave of absence His father wasnt pleased His father smelled what he called girl trouble Yeah but its a damned long sniff from California to Maine Bill Dean said leaning against the drivers door of his truck with his sunburned arms folded He had someone a lot closer than Palm Springs doin his sniffin for him What are you talking about I asked Bout talk People do it for free and most are willing to do even more if theyre paid People like Royce Merrill Royce might be one he agreed but he wouldnt be the only one Times around here dont go between bad and good if youre a local they mostly go between bad and worse So when a guy like Max Devore sends a guy out with a supply of fifty and hundreddollar bills     Was it someone local A lawyer Not a lawyer a realestate broker named Richard Osgood a greasy kind of fella was Bill Deans judgment of him who denned and did business in Motton Eventually Osgood had hired a lawyer from Castle Rock The greasy fellas initial job when the summer of  ended and Lance Devore remained on the TR was to find out what the hell was going on and put a stop to it And then I asked Bill glanced at his watch glanced at the sky then centered his gaze on me He gave a funny little shrug as if to say Were both men of the world in a quiet and settled sort of way  you dont need to ask a silly question like that Then Lance Devore and Mattie Stanchfield got married in the Grace Baptist Church right up there on Highway  There were tales made the rounds about what Osgood mightve done to keep it from comin off  I heard he even tried to bribe Reverend Gooch into refusin to hitch em but I think thats stupid they just would have gone someplace else Sides I dont see much sense in repeating what I dont know for sure Bill unfolded an arm and began to tick items off on the leathery fingers of his right hand They got married in the middle of September  I know that Out popped the thumb People looked around with some curiosity to see if the grooms father would put in an appearance but he never did Out popped the forefinger Added to the thumb it made a pistol Mattie had a baby in April of  making the kiddie a dight premature    but not enough to matter I seen it in the store with my own eyes when it wasnt a week old and it was just the right size Out with the second finger I dont know that Lance Devores old man absolutely refused to help em financially but I do know they were living in that trailer down below Dickies Garage and that makes me think they were havin a pretty hard skate Devore put on the chokechain I said Its what a guy used to getting his own way would do    but if he loved the boy the way you seem to think he might have come around Maybe maybe not He glanced at his watch again Let me finish up quick and get out of your sunshine    but you ought to hear one more little story because it really shows how the land lies In July of last year lessn a month before he died Lance Devore shows up at the postoffice counter in the Lakeview General Hes got a manila envelope he wants to send but first he needs to show Carla DeCinces whats inside She said he was all fluffed out like daddies sometimes get over their kids when theyre small I nodded amused at the idea of skinny stuttery Lance Devore all fluffed out But I could see it in my minds eye and the image was also sort of sweet It was a studio pitcher theyd gotten taken over in the Rock Showed the kid    whats her name Kayla Kyra Ayuh they call em anything these days dont they It showed Kyra sittin in a big leather chair with a pair of joke spectacles on her little snub of a nose lookin at one of the aerial photos of the woods over across the lake in TR or TR  part of what the old man had picked up anyway Carla said the baby had a surprised look on her face as if she hadnt suspected there could be so much woods in the whole world Said it was awful cunnin she did Cunnin as a cat arunnin I murmured And the envelope  Registered Express Mail was addressed to Maxwell Devore in Palm Springs California Leading you to deduce that the old man either thawed enough to ask for a picture of his only grandchild or that Lance Devore thought a picture might thaw him Bill nodded looking as pleased as a parent whose child has managed a difficult sum Dont know if it did he said Wasnt enough time to tell one way or the other Lance had bought one of those little satellite dishes like what youve got here There was a bad storm the day he put it up  hail high wind blowdowns along the lakeshore lots of lightnin That was along toward evening Lance put his dish up in the afternoon all done and safe except around the time the storm commenced he remembered hed left his socket wrench on the trailer roof He went up to get it so it wouldnt get all wet n rusty   He was struck by lightning Jesus Bill Lightnin struck all right but it hit across the way You go past the place where Wasp Hill Road runs into  and youll see the stump of the tree that stroke knocked over Lance was comin down the ladder with his socket wrench when it hit If youve never had a lightnin bolt tear right over your head you dont know how scary it is  its like havin a drunk driver veer across into your lane headed right for you and then swing back onto his own side just in time Close lightnin makes your hair stand up  makes your damned prick stand up Its apt to play the radio on your steel fillins it makes your ears hum and it makes the air taste roasted Lance fell off the ladder If he had time to think anything before he hit the ground I bet he thought he was electrocuted Poor boy He loved the TR but it wasnt lucky for him Broke his neck Ayuh With all the thunder Mattie never heard him fall or yell or anything She looked out a minute or two later when it started to hail and he still wasnt in And there he was layin on the ground and lookin up into the friggin hail with his eyes open Bill looked at his watch one final time then swung open the door to his truck The old man wouldnt come for their weddin but he came for his sons funeral and hes been here ever since He didnt want nawthin to do with the young woman   But he wants the kid I said It was no more than what I already knew but I felt a sinking in the pit of my stomach just the same Dont talk about this Mattie had asked me on the morning of the Fourth Its not a good time for Ki and me How far along in the process has he gotten On the third turn and headin into the home stretch I shd say Therell be a hearin in Castle County Superior Court maybe later this month maybe next The judge could rule then to hand the girl over or put it off until fall I dont think it matters which because the one thing thats never going to happen on Gods green earth is a rulin in favor of the mother One way or another that little girl is going to grow up in California Put that way it gave me a very nasty little chill Bill slid behind the wheel of his truck Stay out of it Mike he said Stay away from Mattie Devore and her daughter And if you get called to court on account of seem the two of em on Saturday smile a lot and say as little as you can Max Devores charging that shes unfit to raise the child Ayuh Bill I saw the child and shes fine He grinned again but this time there was no amusement in it Magine she is But thats not the point Stay clear of their business old boy Its my job to tell you that with Jo gone I guess Im the only caretaker you got He slammed the door of his Ram started the engine reached for the gearshift then dropped his hand again as something else occurred to him If you get a chance you ought to look for the owls What owls Theres a couple of plastic owls around here someplace They might be in ybasement or out in Jos studio They come in by mailorder the fall before she passed on The fall of  Ayuh That cant be right We hadnt used Sara in the fall of  Tis though I was down here puttin on the storm doors when Jo showed up We had us a natter and then the UPS truck come I lugged the box into the entry and had a coffee  I was still drinkin it then  while she took the owls out of the carton and showed em off to me Gorry but they looked real She left not ten minutes after It was like shed come down to do that errand special although why anyoned drive all the way from Derry to take delivery of a couple of plastic owls I dont know When in the fall was it Bill Do you remember Second week of November he said promptly Me n the wife went up to Lewiston later that afternoon to Vettes sisters It was her birthday On our way back we stopped at the Castle Rock Agway so Vette could get her Thanksgiving turkey He looked at me curiously You really didnt know about them owls No Thats a touch peculiar wouldnt you say Maybe she told me and I forgot I said I guess it doesnt matter much now in any case Yet it seemed to matter It was a small thing but it seemed to matter Why would Jo want a couple of plastic owls to begin with To keep the crows from shittin up the woodwork like theyre doing out on your deck Crows see those plastic owls they veer off I burst out laughing in spite of my puzzlement    or perhaps because of it Yeah That really works Ayuh longs you move em every now and then so the crows dont get suspicious Crows are just about the smartest birds going you know You look for those owls save yourself a lot of mess I will I said Plastic owls to scare the crows away  it was exactly the sort of knowledge Jo would come by she was like a crow herself in that way picking up glittery pieces of information that happened to catch her interest and act upon without bothering to tell me All at once I was lonely for her again  missing her like hell Good Some day when Ive got more time well walk the place all the way around Woods too if you want I think youll be satisfied Im sure I will Wheres Devore staying The bushy eyebrows went up Warringtons Him and yous practically neighbors I thought you must know I remembered the woman Id seen  black bathingsuit and black shorts somehow combining to give her an exotic cocktailparty look  and nodded I met his wife Bill laughed heartily enough at that to feel in need of his handkerchief He fished it off the dashboard a blue paisley thing the size of a football pennant and wiped his eyes Whats so funny I asked Skinny woman White hair Face sort of like a kids Halloween mask It was my turn to laugh Thats her She aint his wife shes his whatdoyoucallit personal assistant Rogette Whitmore is her name He pronounced it roGET with a hard G Devores wivesre all dead The last one twenty years What kind of name is Rogette French California he said and shrugged as if that one word explained everything Theres people in town scared of her Is that so Ayuh Bill hesitated then added with one of those smiles we put on when we want others to know that we know were saying something silly Brenda Meserve says shes a witch And the two of them have been staying at Warringtons almost a year Ayuh The Whitmore woman comes n goes but mostly shes been here Thinkin in town is that theyll stay until the custody case is finished off then all go back to California on Devores private jet Leave Osgood to sell Warringtons and   Sell it What do you mean sell it I thought you must know Bill said dropping his gearshift into drive When old Hugh Emerson told Devore they closed the lodge after Thanksgiving Devore told him he had no intention of moving Said he was comfortable right where he was and meant to stay put He bought the place I had been by turns surprised amused and angered over the last twenty minutes but never exactly dumbfounded Now I was He bought Warringtons Lodge so he wouldnt have to move to Lookout Rock Hotel over in Castle View or rent a house Ayuh so he did Nine buildins includin the main lodge and The Sunset Bar twelve acres of woods a sixhole golf course and five hundred feet of shorefront on The Street Plus a twolane bowlin alley and a softball field Four and a quarter million His friend Osgood did the deal and Devore paid with a personal check I wonder how he found room for all those zeros See you Mike With that he backed up the driveway leaving me to stand on the stoop looking after him with my mouth open Plastic owls Bill had told me roughly two dozen interesting things in between peeks at his watch but the one which stayed on top of the pile was the fact and I did accept it as a fact he had been too positive for me not to that Jo had come down here to take delivery on a couple of plastic goddam owls Had she told me She might have I didnt remember her doing so and it seemed to me that I would have but Jo used to claim that when I got in the zone it was no good to tell me anything stuff went in one ear and out the other Sometimes shed pin little notes  errands to run calls to make  to my shirt as if I were a firstgrader But wouldnt I recall if shed said Im going down to Sara hon UPS is delivering something I want to receive personally interested in keeping a lady company Hell wouldnt I have gone I always liked an excuse to go to the TR Except Id been working on that screenplay    and maybe pushing it a little    notes pinned to the sleeve of my shirt    If you go out when youre finished we need milk and orange juice    I inspected what little was left of Jos vegetable garden with the July sun beating down on my neck and thought about owls the plastic goddam owls Suppose Jo had told me she was coming down here to Sara Laughs Suppose I had declined almost without hearing the offer because I was in the writing zone Even if you granted those things there was another question why had she felt the need to come down here personally when she could have just called someone and asked them to meet the delivery truck Kenny Auster would have been happy to do it ditto Mrs M And Bill Dean our caretaker had actually been here This led to other questions  one was why she hadnt just had UPS deliver the damned things to Derry  and finally I decided I couldnt live without actually seeing a bona fide plastic owl for myself Maybe I thought going back to the house Id put one on the roof of my Chew when it was parked in the driveway Forestall future bombing runs I paused in the entry struck by a sudden idea and called Ward Hankins the guy in Waterville who handles my taxes and my few nonwritingrelated business affairs Mike he said heartily Hows the lake The lakes cool and the weathers hot just the way we like it I said Ward you keep all the records we send you for five years dont you Just in case IRS decides to give us some grief Five is accepted practice he said but I hold your stuff for seven  in the eyes of the tax boys youre a mighty fat pigeon Better a fat pigeon than a plastic owl I thought but didnt say What I said was That includes desk calendars right Mine and Jos up until she died You bet Since neither of you kept diaries it was the best way to crossreference receipts and claimed expenses with   Could you find Jos desk calendar for  and see what she had going in the second week of November Td be happy to What in particular are you looking for For a moment I saw myself sitting at my kitchen table in Derry on my first night as a widower holding up a box with the words Norco Home Pregnancy Test printed on the side Exactly what was I looking for at this late date Considering that I had loved the lady and she was almost four years in her grave what was I looking for Besides trouble that was Im looking for two plastic owls I said Ward probably thought I was talking to him but Im not sure I was I know that sounds weird but its what Im doing Can you call me back Within the hour Good man I said and hung up Now for the actual owls themselves Where was the most likely spot to store two such interesting artifacts My eyes went to the cellar door Elementary my dear Watson The cellar stairs were dark and mildly dank As I stood on the landing groping for the lightswitch the door banged shut behind me with such force that I cried out in surprise There was no breeze no draft the day was perfectly still but the door banged shut just the same Or was sucked shut I stood in the dark at the top of the stairs feeling for the lightswitch smelling that oozy smell that even good concrete foundations get after awhile if there is no proper airingout It was cold much colder than it had been on the other side of the door I wasnt alone and I knew it I was afraid Id be a liar to say I wasnt    but I was also fascinated Something was with me Something was in here with me I dropped my hand away from the wall where the switch was and just stood with my arms at my sides Some time passed I dont know how much My heart was beating furiously in my chest I could feel it in my temples It was cold Hello I asked Nothing in response I could hear the faint irregular drip of water as condensation fell from one of the pipes down below I could hear my own breathing and faintly  far away in another world where the sun was out  I could hear the triumphant caw of a crow Perhaps it had just dropped a load on the hood of my car I really need an owl I thought In fact I dont know how I ever got along without one Hello I asked again Can you talk Nothing I wet my lips I should have felt silly perhaps standing there in the dark and calling to the ghosts But I didnt Not a bit The damp had been replaced by a coldness I could feel and I had company Oh yes Can you tap then If you can shut the door you must be able to tap I stood there and listened to the soft isolated drips from the pipes There was nothing else I was reaching out for the lightswitch again when there was a soft thud from not far below me The cellar of Sara Laughs is high and the upper three feet of the concrete  the part which lies against the grounds frostbelt  had been insulated with big silverbacked panels of InsuGard The sound that I heard was I am quite sure a fist striking against one of these Just a fist hitting a square of insulation but every gut and muscle of my body seemed to come unwound My hair stood up My eyesockets seemed to be expanding and my eyeballs contracting as if my head were trying to turn into a skull Every inch of my skin broke out in gooseflesh Something was in here with me Very likely something dead I could no longer have turned on the light if Id wanted to I no longer had the strength to raise my arm I tried to talk and at last in a husky whisper I hardly recognized I said Are you really there Thud Who are you I could still do no better than that husky whisper the voice of a man giving last instructions to his family as he lies on his deathbed This time there was nothing from below I tried to think and what came to my struggling mind was Tony Curtis as Harry Houdini in some old movie According to the film Houdini had been the Diogenes of the Ouija board circuit a guy who spent his spare time just looking for an honest medium Hed attended one sance where the dead communicated by  Tap once for yes twice for no I said Can you do that Thud It was on the stairs below me    but not too far below Five steps down six or seven at most Not quite close enough to touch if I should reach out and wave my hand in the black basement air    a thing I could imagine but not actually imagine doing Are you     My voice trailed off There was simply no strength in my diaphragm Chilly air lay on my chest like a flatiron I gathered all my will and tried again Are you Jo Thud That soft fist on the insulation A pause and then Thudthud Yes and no Then with no idea why I was asking such an inane question Are the owls down here Thudthud Do you know where they are Thud Should I look for them Thud Very hard Why did she want them I could ask but the thing on the stairs had no way to an Hot fingers touched my eyes and I almost screamed before realizing it was sweat I raised my hands in the dark and wiped the heels of them up my face to the hairline They skidded as if on oil Cold or not I was all but bathing in my own sweat Are you Lance Devore Thudthud at once Is it safe for me at Sara Am I safe Thud A pause And I knew it was a pause that the thing on the stairs wasnt finished Then Thudthud Yes I was safe No I wasnt safe I had regained marginal control of my arm I reached out felt along the wall and found the lightswitch I settled my fingers on it Now the sweat on my face felt as if it were turning to ice Are you the person who cries in the night I asked Thudthud from below me and between the two thuds I flicked the switch The cellar globes came on So did a brilliant hanging bulb at least a hundred and twentyfive watts  over the landing There was no time for anyone to hide let alone get away and no one there to try either Also Mrs Meserve  admirable in so many ways  had neglected to sweep the cellar stairs When I went down to where I estimated the thudding sounds had been coming from I left tracks in the light dust But mine were the only ones I blew out breath in front of me and could see it So it had been cold still was cold    but it was warming up fast I blew out another breath and could see just a hint of fog A third exhale and there was nothing I ran my palm over one of the insulated squares Smooth I pushed a finger at it and although I didnt push with any real force my finger left a dimple in the silvery surface Easy as pie If someone had been thumping a fist down here this stuff should be pitted the thin silver skin perhaps even broken to reveal the pink fill underneath But all the squares were smooth Are you still there I asked No response and yet I had a sense that my visitor was still there Somewhere I hope I didnt offend you by turning on the light I said and now I did feel slightly odd standing on my cellar stairs and talking out loud sermonizing to the spiders I wanted to see you if I could I had no idea if that was true or not Suddenly  so suddenly I almost lost my balance and tumbled down the stairs  I whirled around convinced the shroudcreature was behind me that it had been the thing knocking it no polite M R James ghost but a horror from around the rim of the universe There was nothing I turned around again took two or three deep steadying breaths and then went the rest of the way down the cellar stairs Beneath them was a perfectly serviceable canoe complete with paddle In the corner was the gas stove wed replaced after buying the place also the clawfoot tub Jo had wanted over my objections to turn into a planter I found a trunk filled with vaguely recalled tablelinen a box of mildewy cassette tapes groups like the Delfonics Funkadelic and  Special several cartons of old dishes There was a life down here but ultimately not a very interesting one Unlike the life Id sensed in Jos studio this one hadnt been cut short but evolved out of shed like old skin and that was all right Was in fact the natural order of things There was a photo album on a shelf of knickknacks and I took it down both curious and wary No bombshells this time however nearly all the pix were landscape shots of Sara Laughs as it had been when we bought it I found a picture of Jo in bellbottoms though her hair parted in the middle and white lipstick on her mouth and one of Michael Noonan wearing a flowered shirt and muttonchop sideburns that made me cringe the bachelor Mike in the photo was a Barry White kind of guy I didnt want to recognize and yet did I found Jos old broken treadmill a rake Id want if I was still around here come fall a snowblower Id want even more if I was around come winter and several cans of paint What I didnt find was any plastic owls My insulationthumping friend had been right Upstairs the telephone started ringing I hurried to answer it going out through the cellar door and then reaching back in to flick off the lightswitch This amused me and at the same time seemed like perfectly normal behavior    just as being careful not to step on sidewalk cracks had seemed like perfectly normal behavior to me when I was a kid And even if it wasnt normal what did it matter Id only been back at Sara for three days but already Id postulated Noonans First Law of Eccentricity when youre on your own strange behavior really doesnt seem strange at all I snagged the cordless Hello Hi Mike Its Ward That was quick The filerooms just a short walk down the hall he said Easy as pie Theres only one thing on Jos calendar for the second week of November in  It says SKs of Maine Freep  AM Thats on Tuesday the sixteenth Does it help Yes I said Thank you Ward It helps a lot I broke the connection and put the phone back in its cradle Yes it helped SKs of Maine was Soup Kitchens of Maine Jo had been on their board of directors from  until her death Freep was Freeport It must have been a board meeting They had probably discussed plans for feeding the homeless on Thanksgiving    and then Jo had driven the seventy or so miles to the TR in order to take delivery of two plastic owls It didnt answer all the questions but arent there always questions in the wake of a loved ones death And no statute of limitations on when they come up The UFO voice spoke up then While youre right here by the phone it said why not call Bonnie Amudson Say hi see how shes doing Jo had been on four different boards during the nineties all of them doing charitable work Her friend Bonnie had persuaded her onto the Soup Kitchens board when a seat fell vacant They had gone to a lot of the meetings together Not the one in November of  presumably and Bonnie could hardly be expected to remember that one particular meeting almost five years later    but if shed saved her old minutesofthemeeting sheets    Exactly what the fuck was I thinking of Calling Bonnie making nice then asking her to check her December  minutes Was I going to ask her if the attendance report had my wife absent from the November meeting Was I going to ask if maybe Jo had seemed different that last year of her life And when Bonnie asked me why I wanted to know what would I say Give me that Jo had snarled in my dream of her In the dream she hadnt looked like Jo at all shed looked like some other woman maybe like the one in the Book of Proverbs the strange woman whose lips were as honey but whose heart was full of gall and wormwood A strange woman with fingers as cold as twigs after a frost Give me that its my dustcatcher I went to the cellar door and touched the knob I turned it    then let it go I didnt want to look down there into the dark didnt want to risk the chance that something might start thumping again It was better to leave that door shut What I wanted was something cold to drink I went into the kitchen reached for the fridge door then stopped The magnets were back in a circle again but this time four letters and one number had been pulled into the center and lined up there They spelled a single lowercase word hello There was something here Even back in broad daylight I had no doubt of that Id asked if it was safe for me to be here and had received a mixed message    but that didnt matter If I left Sara now there was nowhere to go I had a key to the house in Derry but matters had to be resolved here I knew that too Hello I said and opened the fridge to get a soda Whoever or whatever you are hello I woke in the early hours of the following morning convinced that there was someone in the north bedroom with me I sat up against the pillows rubbed my eyes and saw a dark shouldery shape standing between me and the window Who are you I asked thinking that it wouldnt reply in words it would instead thump on the wall Once for yes twice for no whats on your mind Houdini But the figure standing by the window made no reply at all I groped up found the string hanging from the light over the bed and yanked it My mouth was turned down in a grimace my midsection tensed so tight it felt as if bullets would have bounced off Oh shit I said Fuck me til I cry Dangling from a hanger Id hooked over the curtain rod was my old suede jacket Id parked it there while unpacking and had then forgotten to store it away in the closet I tried to laugh and couldnt At three in the morning it just didnt seem that funny I turned off the light and lay back down with my eyes open waiting for Bunters bell to ring or the childish sobbing to start I was still listening when I fell asleep Seven hours or so later as I was getting ready to go out to Jos studio and see if the plastic owls were in the storage area where I hadnt checked the day before a latemodel Ford rolled down my driveway and stopped nose to nose with my Chevy I had gotten as far as the short path between the house and the studio but now I came back The day was hot and breathless and I was wearing nothing but a pair of cutoff jeans and plastic flipflops on my feet Jo always claimed that the Cleveland style of dressing divided itself naturally into two subgenres Full Cleveland and Cleveland Casual My visitor that Tuesday morning was wearing Cleveland Casual  you had your Hawaiian shirt with pineapples and monkeys your tan slacks from Banana Republic your white loafers Socks are optional but white footgear is a necessary part of the Cleveland look as is at least one piece of gaudy gold jewelry This fellow was totally okay in the latter department he had a Rolex on one wrist and a goldlink chain around his neck The tail of his shirt was out and there was a suspicious lump at the back It was either a gun or a beeper and looked too big to be a beeper I glanced at the car again Blackwall tires And on the dashboard oh look at this a covered blue bubble The better to creep up on you unsuspected Gramma Michael Noonan He was handsome in a way that would be attractive to certain women  the kind who cringe when anybody in their immediate vicinity raises his voice the kind who rarely call the police when things go wrong at home because on some miserable secret level they believe they deserve things to go wrong at home Wrong things that result in black eyes dislocated elbows the occasional cigarette burn on the booby These are women who more often than not call their husbands or lovers daddy as in Can I bring you a beer daddy or Did you have a hard day at work daddy Yes Im Michael Noonan How can I help you This version of daddy turned bent and grabbed something from the litter of paperwork on the passenger side of the front seat Beneath the dash a twoway radio squawked once briefly and fell silent He turned back to me with a long buffcolored folder in one hand Held it out This is yours When I didnt take it he stepped forward and tried to poke it into one of my palms which would presumably cause me to close my fingers in a kind of reflex Instead I raised both hands to shoulderlevel as if he had just told me to put em up Muggsy He looked at me patiently his face as Irish as the Arlen brothers but without the Arlen look of kindness openness and curiosity What was there in place of those things was a species of sour amusement as if hed seen all of the worlds pissier behavior most of it twice One of his eyebrows had been split open a long time ago and his cheeks had that reddish windburned look that indicates either ruddy good health or a deep interest in grainalcohol products He looked like he could knock you into the gutter and then sit on you to keep you there I been good daddy get off me dont be mean Dont make this tough Youre gonna take service of this and we both know it so dont make this tough Show me some ID first He sighed rolled his eyes then reached into one of his shirt pockets He brought out a leather folder and flipped it open There was a badge and a photo ID My new friend was George Footman Deputy Sheriff Castle County The photo was flat and shadowless like something an assault victim would see in a mugbook Okay he asked I took the buffbacked document when he held it out again He stood there broadcasting that sense of curdled amusement as I scanned it I had been subpoenaed to appear in the Castle Rock office of Elmer Durgin AttorneyatLaw at ten oclock on the morning of July    Friday in other words Said Elmer Durgin had been appointed guardian ad litem of Kyra Elizabeth Devore a minor child He would take a deposition from me concerning any knowledge I might have of Kyra Elizabeth Devore in regard to her wellbeing This deposition would be taken on behalf of Castle County Superior Court and Judge Noble Rancourt A stenographer would be present I was assured that this was the courts depo and nothing to do with either Plaintiff or Defendant Footman said Its my job to remind you of the penalties should you fail   Thanks but lets just assume you told me all about those okay Ill be there I made shooing gestures at his car I felt deeply disgusted    and I felt interfered with I had never been served with a process before and I didnt care for it He went back to his car started to swing in then stopped with one hairy arm hung over the top of the open door His Rolex gleamed in the hazy sunlight Let me give you a piece of advice he said and that was enough to tell me anything else I needed to know about the guy Dont fuck with Mr Devore Or hell squash me like a bug I said Huh Your actual lines are Let me give you a piece of advice  dont fuck with Mr Devore or hell squash you like a bug I could see by his expression  half past perplexed going on angry  that he had meant to say something very much like that Obviously wed seen the same movies including all those in which Robert De Niro plays a psycho Then his face cleared Oh sure youre the writer he said Thats what they tell me You can say stuff like that cause youre a writer Well its a free country isnt it Aint you a smartass now How long have you been working for Max Devore Deputy And does the County Sheriffs office know youre moonlighting They know Its not a problem Youre the one that might have the problem Mr Smartass Writer I decided it was time to quit this before we descended to the kakapoopie stage of namecalling Get out of my driveway please Deputy He looked at me a moment longer obviously searching for that perfect capper line and not finding it He needed a Mr Smartass Writer to help him that was all Ill be looking for you on Friday he said Does that mean youre going to buy me lunch Dont worry Im a fairly cheap date His reddish cheeks darkened a degree further and I could see what they were going to look like when he was sixty if he didnt lay off the firewater in the meantime He got back into his Ford and reversed up my driveway hard enough to make his tires holler I stood where I was watching him go Once he was headed back out Lane Fortytwo to the highway I went into the house It occurred to me that Deputy Footmans extracurricular job must pay well if he could afford a Rolex On the other hand maybe it was a knockoff Settle down Michael Jos voice advised The red rag is gone now no ones waving anything in front of you so just settle  I shut her voice out I didnt want to settle down I wanted to settle up I had been interfered with I walked over to the hall desk where Jo and I had always kept our pending documents and our desk calendars now that I thought about it and tacked the summons to the bulletin board by one corner of its buffcolored jacket With that much accomplished I raised my fist in front of my eyes looked at the wedding ring on it for a moment then slammed it against the wall beside the bookcase I did it hard enough to make an entire row of paperbacks jump I thought about Mattie Devores baggy shorts and Kmart smock then about her fatherinlaw paying four and a quarter million dollars for Warringtons Writing a personal goddamned check I thought about Bill Dean saying that one way or another that little girl was going to grow up in California I walked back and forth through the house still simmering and finally ended up in front of the fridge The circle of magnets was the same but the letters inside had changed Instead of hello they now read help r Helper I said and as soon as I heard the word out loud I understood The letters on the fridge consisted of only a single alphabet no not even that I saw g and x had been lost someplace and Id have to get more If the front of my Kenmore was going to become a Ouija board Id need a good supply of letters Especially vowels In the meantime I moved the h and the e in front of the r Now the message read lp her I scattered the circle of fruit and vegetable magnets with my palm spread the letters and resumed pacing I had made a decision not to get between Devore and his daughterinlaw but Id wound up between them anyway A deputy in Cleveland clothing had shown up in my driveway complicating a life that already had its problems    and scaring me a little in the bargain But at least it was a fear of something I could see and understand All at once I decided I wanted to do more with the summer than worry about ghosts crying kids and what my wife had been up to four or five years ago    if in fact she had been up to anything I couldnt write books but that didnt mean I had to pick scabs Help her I decided I would at least try Harold Oblowski Literary Agency Come to Belize with me Nola I said I need you Well make beautiful love at midnight when the full moon turns the beach to a bone Hello Mr Noonan she said No sense of humor had Nola No sense of romance either In some ways that made her perfect for the Oblowski Agency Would you like to speak to Harold If hes in He is Please hold One nice thing about being a best selling author  even one whose books only appear as a general rule on lists that go to fifteen  is that your agent almost always happens to be in Another is if hes vacationing on Nantucket hell be in to you there A third is that the time you spend on hold is usually quite short Mike he cried Hows the lake I thought about you all weekend Yeah I thought and pigs will whistle Things are fine in general but shitty in one particular Harold I need to talk to a lawyer I thought first about calling Ward Hankins for a recommendation but then I decided I wanted somebody a little more highpowered than Ward was likely to know Someone with filed teeth and a taste for human flesh would be nice This time Harold didnt bother with the longpause routine Whats up Mike Are you in trouble Thump once for yes twice for no I thought and for one wild moment thought of actually doing just that I remembered finishing Christy Browns memoir Down All the Days and wondering what it would be like to write an entire book with the pen grasped between the toes of your left foot Now I wondered what it would be like to go through eternity with no way to communicate but rapping on the cellar wall And even then only certain people would be able to hear and understand you    and only those certain people at certain times Jo was it you And if it was why did you answer both ways Mike Are you there Yes This isnt really my trouble Harold so cool your jets I do have a problem though Your main guy is Goldacre right Right Ill call him right aw   But he deals primarily with contracts law I was thinking out loud now and when I paused Harold didnt fill it Sometimes hes an allright guy Most times really Call him for me anyway would you Tell him I need to talk to an attorney with a good working knowledge of childcustody law Have him put me in touch with the best one whos free to take a case immediately One who can be in court with me Friday if thats necessary Is it paternity he asked sounding both respectful and afraid No custody I thought about telling him to get the whole story from the Lawyer to Be Named Later but Harold deserved better    and would demand to hear my version sooner or later anyway no matter what the lawyer told him I gave him an account of my Fourth of July morning and its aftermath I stuck with the Devores mentioning nothing about voices crying children or thumps in the dark Harold only interrupted once and that was when he realized who the villain of the piece was Youre asking for trouble he said You know that dont you Im in for a certain measure of it in any case I said Ive decided I want to dish out a little as well thats all You will not have the peace and quiet that a writer needs to do his best work Harold said in an amusingly prim voice I wondered what the reaction would be if I said that was okay I hadnt written anything more riveting than a grocery list since Jo died and maybe this would stir me up a little But I didnt Never let em see you sweat the Noonan clans motto Someone should carve DONT WORRY IM FINE on the door of the family crypt Then I thought help r That young woman needs a friend I said and Jo would have wanted me to be one to her Jo didnt like it when the little folks got stepped on You think Yeah Okay Ill see who I can find And Mike    do you want me to come up on Friday for this depo No It came out sounding needlessly abrupt and was followed by a silence that seemed not calculated but hurt Listen Harold my caretaker said the actual custody hearing is scheduled soon If it happens and you still want to come up Ill give you a call I can always use your moral support  you know that In my case its immoral support he replied but he sounded cheery again We said goodbye I walked back to the fridge and looked at the magnets They were still scattered hell to breakfast and that was sort of a relief Even the spirits must have to rest sometimes I took the cordless phone went out onto the deck and plonked down in the chair where Id been on the night of the Fourth when Devore called Even after my visit from daddy I could still hardly believe that conversation Devore had called me a liar I had told him to stick my telephone number up his ass We were off to a great start as neighbors I pulled the chair a little closer to the edge of the deck which dropped a giddy forty feet or so to the slope between Saras backside and the lake I looked for the green woman Id seen while swimming telling myself not to be a dope  things like that you can see only from one angle stand even ten feet off to one side or the other and theres nothing to look at But this was apparently a case of the exceptions proving the rule I was both amused and a little uneasy to realize that the birch down there by The Street looked like a woman from the land side as well as from the lake Some of it was due to the pine just behind it  that bare branch jutting off to the north like a bony pointing arm  but not all of it From back here the birchs white limbs and narrow leaves still made a womans shape and when the wind shook the lower levels of the tree the green and silver swirled like long skirts I had said no to Harolds wellmeant offer to come up almost before it was fully articulated and as I looked at the treewoman rather ghostly in her own right I knew why Harold was loud Harold was insensitive to nuance Harold might frighten off whatever was here I didnt want that I was scared yes  standing on those dark cellar stairs and listening to the thumps from just below me I had been fucking terrified  but I had also felt fully alive for the first time in years I was touching something in Sara that was entirely beyond my experience and it fascinated me The cordless phone rang in my lap making me jump I grabbed it expecting Max Devore or perhaps Footman his overgolded minion It turned out to be a lawyer named John Storrow who sounded as if he might have graduated from law school fairly recently  like last week Still he worked for the firm of Avery McLain and Bernstein on Park Avenue and Park Avenue is a pretty good address for a lawyer even one who still has a few of his milkteeth If Henry Goldacre said Storrow was good he probably was And his specialty was custody law Now tell me whats happening up there he said when the introductions were over and the background had been sketched in I did my best feeling my spirits rise a little as the tale wound on Theres something oddly comforting about talking to a legal guy once the billablehours clock has started running you have passed the magical point at which a lawyer becomes your lawyer Your lawyer is warm your lawyer is sympathetic your lawyer makes notes on a yellow pad and nods in all the right places Most of the questions your lawyer asks are questions you can answer And if you cant your lawyer will help you find a way to do so by God Your lawyer is always on your side Your enemies are his enemies To him you are never shit but always Shinola When I had finished John Storrow said Wow Im surprised the papers havent gotten hold of this That never occurred to me But I could see his point The Devore family saga wasnt for the New York Times or Boston Globe probably not even for the Derry News but in weekly supermarket tabs like The National Enquirer or Inside View it would fit like a glove  instead of the girl King Kong decides to snatch the girls innocent child and carry it with him to the top of the Empire State Building Oh eek unhand that baby you brute It wasnt frontpage stuff no blood or celebrity morgue shots but as a page nine shouter it would do nicely In my mind I composed a headline blaring over sidebyside pix of Warringtons Lodge and Matties rusty doublewide COMPUKING LIVES IN SPLENDOR AS HE TRIES TO TAKE YOUNG BEAUTYS ONLY CHILD Probably too long I decided I wasnt writing anymore and still I needed an editor That was pretty sad when you stopped to think about it Perhaps at some point well see that they do get the story Storrow said in a musing tone I realized that this was a man I could grow attached to at least in my present angry mood He grew brisker Whom I representing here Mr Noonan You or the young lady I vote for the young lady The young lady doesnt even know Ive called you She may think Ive taken a bit too much on myself She may in fact give me the rough side of her tongue Why would she do that Because shes a Yankee  a Maine Yankee the worst kind On a given day they can make the Irish look logical Perhaps but shes the one with the target pinned to her shirt I suggest that you call and tell her that I promised I would It wasnt a hard promise to make either Id known Id have to be in touch with her ever since I had accepted the summons from Deputy Footman And who stands for Michael Noonan come Friday morning Storrow laughed dryly Ill find someone local to do that Hell go into this Durgins office with you sit quietly with his briefcase on his lap and listen I may be in town by that point  I wont know until I talk to Ms Devore  but I wont be in Durgins office When the custody hearing comes around though youll see my face in the place All right good Call me with the name of my new lawyer My other new lawyer Uhhuh In the meantime talk to the young lady Get me a job Ill try Also try to stay visible if youre with her he said If we give the bad guys room to get nasty theyll get nasty Theres nothing like that between you is there Nothing nasty Sorry to have to ask but I do have to ask No I said Its been quite some time since Ive been up to anything nasty with anyone Im tempted to commiserate Mr Noonan but under the circumstances   Mike Make it Mike Good I like that And Im John People are going to talk about your involvement anyway You know that dont you Sure People know I can afford you Theyll speculate about how she can afford me Pretty young widow middleaged widower Sex would seem the most likely Youre a realist I dont really think I am but I know a hawk from a handsaw I hope you do because the ride could get rough This is an extremely rich man were going up against Yet he didnt sound scared He sounded almost    greedy He sounded the way part of me had felt when I saw that the magnets on the fridge were back in a circle I know he is In court that wont matter a whole helluva lot because theres a certain amount of money on the other side Also the judge is going to be very aware that this one is a powderkeg That can be useful Whats the best thing weve got going for us I asked this thinking of Kyras rosy unmarked face and her complete lack of fear in the presence of her mother I asked it thinking John would reply that the charges were clearly unfounded I thought wrong The best thing Devores age Hes got to be older than God Based on what Ive heard over the weekend I think he must be eightyfive That would make God older Yeah but as a potential dad he makes Tony Randall look like a teenager John said and now he sounded positively gloating Think of it Michael  the kid graduates from high school the year Gramps turns one hundred Also theres a chance the old mans overreached himself Do you know what a guardian ad litem is No Essentially its a lawyer the court appoints to protect the interests of the child A fee for the service comes out of court costs but its a pittance Most people who agree to serve as guardian ad litem have strictly altruistic motives    but not all of them In any case the ad litem puts his own spin on the case Judges dont have to take the guys advice but they almost always do It makes a judge look stupid to reject the advice of his own appointee and the thing a judge hates above all others is looking stupid Devore will have his own lawyer John laughed How about half a dozen at the actual custody hearing Are you serious The guy is eightyfive Thats too old for Ferraris too old for bungee jumping in Tibet and too old for whores unless hes a mighty man What does that leave for him to spend his money on Lawyers I said bleakly Yep And Mattie Devore What does she get Thanks to you she gets me John Storrow said Its like a John Grisham novel isnt it Pure gold Meantime Im interested in Durgin the ad litem If Devore hasnt been expecting any real trouble he may have been unwise enough to put temptation in Durgins way And Durgin may have been stupid enough to succumb Hey who knows what we might find But I was a turn back She gets you I said Thanks to me And if I wasnt here to stick in my oar What would she get then Bubkes Thats Yiddish It means   I know what it means I said Thats incredible Nope just American justice You know the lady with the scales The one who stands outside most city courthouses Uhhuh Slap some handcuffs on that broads wrists and some tape over her mouth to go along with the blindfold rape her and roll her in the mud You like that image I dont but its a fair representation of how the law works in custody cases where the plaintiff is rich and the defendant is poor And sexual equality has actually made it worse because while mothers still tend to be poor they are no longer seen as the automatic choice for custody Mattie Devores got to have you doesnt she Yes John said simply Call me tomorrow and tell me that she will I hope I can do that So do I And listen  theres one more thing What You lied to Devore on the telephone Bullshit Nope nope I hate to contradict my sisters favorite author but you did and you know it You told Devore that mother and child were out together the kid was picking flowers everything was fine You put everything in there except Bambi and Thumper I was sitting up straight in my deckchair now I felt sandbagged I also felt that my own cleverness had been overlooked Hey no think again I never came out and said anything I told him I assumed I used the word more than once I remember that very clearly Uhhuh and if he was taping your conversation youll get a chance to actually count how many times you used it At first I didnt answer I was thinking back to the conversation Id had with him remembering the underhum on the phone line the characteristic underhum I remembered from all my previous summers at Sara Laughs Had that steady low mmmmm been even more noticeable on Saturday night I guess maybe there could be a tape I said reluctantly Uhhuh And if Devores lawyer gets it to the ad litem how do you think youll sound Careful I said Maybe like a man with something to hide Or a man spinning yarns And youre good at that arent you After all its what you do for a living At the custody hearing Devores lawyer is apt to mention that If he then produces one of the people who passed you shortly after Mattie arrived on the scene    a person who testifies that the young lady seemed upset and flustered    how do you think youll sound then Like a liar I said and then Ah fuck Fear not Mike Be of good cheer What should I do Spike their guns before they can fire them Tell Durgin exactly what happened Get it in the depo Emphasize the fact that the little girl thought she was walking safely Make sure you get in that crossmock thing I love that Then if they have a tape theyll play it and Ill look like a storychanging schmuck I dont think so You werent a sworn witness when you talked to Devore were you There you were sitting out on your deck and minding your own business watching the fireworks show Out of the blue this grouchy old asshole calls you Starts ranting Didnt even give him your number did you No Your unlisted number No And while he said he was Maxwell Devore he could have been anyone right Right He could have been the Shah of Iran No the Shahs dead The Shahs out then But he could have been a nosy neighbor    or a prankster Yes And you said what you said with all those possibilities in mind But now that youre part of an official court proceeding youre telling the whole truth and nothing but You bet That good mylawyer feeling had deserted me for a bit but it was back fullforce now You cant do better than the truth Mike he said solemnly Except maybe in a few cases and this isnt one Are we clear on that Yes All right were done I want to hear from either you or Mattie Devore around elevenish tomorrow It ought to be her Ill try If she really balks you know what to do dont you I think so Thanks John One way or another well talk very soon he said and hung up I sat where I was for awhile Once I pushed the button which opened the line on the cordless phone then pushed it again to close it I had to talk to Mattie but I wasnt quite ready yet I decided to take a walk instead If she really balks you know what to do dont you Of course Remind her that she couldnt afford to be proud That she couldnt afford to go all Yankee refusing charity from Michael Noonan author of Being Two The RedShirt Man and the soontobepublished Helens Promise Remind her that she could have her pride or her daughter but likely not both Hey Mattie pick one I walked almost to the end of the lane stopping at Tidwells Meadow with its pretty view down to the cup of the lake and across to the White Mountains The water dreamed under a hazy sky looking gray when you tipped your head one way blue when you tipped it the other That sense of mystery was very much with me That sense of Manderley Over forty black people had settled here at the turn of the century  lit here for awhile anyway  according to Marie Hingerman also according to A History of Castle County and Castle Rock a weighty tome published in  the countys bicentennial year Pretty special black people too most of them related most of them talented most of them part of a musical group which had first been called The RedTop Boys and then Sara Tidwell and the RedTop Boys They had bought the meadow and a goodsized tract of lakeside land from a man named Douglas Day The money had been saved up over a period of ten years according to Sonny Tidwell who did the dickering as a RedTop Son Tidwell had played what was then known as chickenscratch guitar There had been a vast uproar about it in town and even a meeting to protest the advent of these darkies which come in a Horde Things had settled down and turned out okay as things have a way of doing more often than not The shanty town most locals had expected on Days Hill for so Tidwells Meadow was called in  when Son Tidwell bought the land on behalf of his extensive clan had never appeared Instead a number of neat white cabins sprang up surrounding a larger building that might have been intended as a group meeting place a rehearsal area or perhaps at some point a performance hall Sara and the RedTop Boys sometimes there was a RedTop Girl in there as well membership in the band was fluid changing with every performance played around western Maine for over a year maybe closer to two years In towns all up and down the Western Line  Farmington Skowhegan Bridgton Gates Falls Castle Rock Morton Fryeburg  youll still come across their old showposters at barn bazaars and junkatoriums Sara and the RedTops were great favorites on the circuit and they got along all right at home on the TR too which never surprised me At the end of the day Robert Frost  that utilitarian and often unpleasant poet  was right in the northeastern three we really do believe that good fences make good neighbors We squawk and then keep a miserly peace the kind with gimlet eyes and a tuckeddown mouth They pay their bills we say I aint never had to shoot one a their dogs we say They keep themselves to themselves we say as if isolation were a virtue And of course the defining virtue They dont take charity And at some point Sara Tidwell became Sara Laughs In the end though TR mustnt have been what they wanted because after playing a county fair or two in the late summer of  the clan moved on Their neat little cabins provided summerrental income for the Day family until  when they burned in the summer fires which charred the east and north sides of the lake End of story Except for her music that was Her music had lived I got up from the rock I had been sitting on stretched my arms and my back and walked back down the lane singing one of her songs as I went During my hike back down the lane to the house I tried to think about nothing at all My first editor used to say that eightyfive percent of what goes on in a novelists head is none of his business a sentiment Ive never believed should be restricted to just writers Socalled higher thought is by and large highly overrated When trouble comes and steps have to be taken I find its generally better to just stand aside and let the boys in the basement do their work Thats bluecollar labor down there nonunion guys with lots of muscles and tattoos Instinct is their specialty and they refer problems upstairs for actual cogitation only as a last resort When I tried to call Mattie Devore an extremely peculiar thing happened one that had nothing at all ro do with spooks as far as I could tell Instead of an openhum line when I pushed the cordlesss on button I got silence Then just as I was thinking I must have left the phone in the north bedroom off the hook I realized it wasnt complete silence Distant as a radio transmission from deep space cheerful and quacky as an animated duck some guy with a fair amount of Brooklyn in his voice was singing He followed her to school one day school one day school one day Followed her to school one day which was against the rule     I opened my mouth to ask who was there but before I could a womans voice said Hello She sounded perplexed and doubtful Mattie In my confusion it never occurred to me to call her something more formal like Ms or Mrs Devore Nor did it seem odd that I should know who it was based on a single word even though our only previous conversation had been relatively brief Maybe the guys in the basement recognized the background music and made the connection to Kyra Mr Noonan She sounded more bewildered than ever The phone never even rang I must have picked mine up just as your call was going through I said That happens from time to time But how many times I wondered did it happen when the person calling you was the one you yourself had been planning to call Maybe quite often actually Telepathy or coincidence Live or Memorex Either way it seemed almost magical I looked across the long low living room into the glassy eyes of Bunter the moose and thought Yes but maybe this is a magic place now I suppose she said doubtfully I apologize about calling in the first place  its a presumption Your numbers unlisted I know Oh dont worry about that I thought Everyones got this old number by now In fact Im thinking about putting it in the Yellow Pages I got it from your file at the library she went on sounding embarrassed Thats where I work In the background Mary Had a Little Lamb had given way to The Farmer in the Dell Its quite all right I said Especially since youre the person I was picking up the phone to call Me Why Ladies first She gave a brief nervous laugh I wanted to invite you to dinner That is Ki and I want to invite you to dinner I should have done it before now You were awfully good to us the other day Will you come Yes I said with no hesitation at all With thanks Weve got some things to talk about anyway There was a pause In the background the mouse was taking the cheese As a kid I used to think all these things happened in a vast gray factory called The HiHo DairyO Mattie Still there Hes dragged you into it hasnt he That awful old man Now her voice sounded not nervous but somehow dead Well yes and no You could argue that fate dragged me into it or coincidence or God I wasnt there that morning because of Max Devore I was chasing the elusive Villageburger She didnt laugh but her voice brightened a little and I was glad People who talk in that dead affectless way are by and large frightened people Sometimes people who have been outright terrorized Im still sorry for dragging you into my trouble I had an idea she might start to wonder who was dragging whom after I pitched her on John Storrow and was glad it was a discussion I wouldnt have to have with her on the phone In any case Id love to come to dinner When Would this evening be too soon Absolutely not Thats wonderful We have to eat early though so my little guy doesnt fall asleep in her dessert Is six okay Yes Ki will be excited We dont have much company She hasnt been wandering again has she I thought she might be offended Instead this time she did laugh God no All the fuss on Saturday scared her Now she comes in to tell me if shes switching from the swing in the side yard to the sandbox in back Shes talked about you a lot though She calls you that tall guy who carrot me I think shes worried you might be mad at her Tell her Im not I said No check that Ill tell her myself Can I bring anything Bottle of wine she asked a little doubtfully Or maybe thats pretentious  I was only going to cook hamburgers on the grill and make potato salad Ill bring an unpretentious bottle Thank you she said This is sort of exciting We never have company I was horrified to find myself on the verge of saying that I thought it was sort of exciting too my first date in four years and all Thanks so much for thinking of me As I hung up I remembered John Storrow advising me to try and stay visible with her not to hand over any extra grist for the town gossip mill If she was barbecuing wed probably be out where people could see we had our clothes on    for most of the evening anyway Shewould however likely do the polite thing at some point and invite me inside I would then do the polite thing and go Admire her velvet Elvis painting on the wall or her commemorative plates from the Franklin Mint or whatever she had going in the way of trailer decoration Id let Kyra show me her bedroom and exclaim with wonder over her excellent assortment of stuffed animals and her favorite dolly if that was required There are all sorts of priorities in life Some your lawyer can understand but I suspect there are quite a few he cant Am I handling this right Bunter I asked the stuffed moose Bellow once for yes twice for no I was halfway down the hall leading to the north wing thinking of nothing but a cool shower when from behind me very soft came a brief ring of the bell around Bunters neck I stopped head cocked my shirt held in one hand waiting for the bell to ring again It didnt After a minute I went the rest of the way to the bathroom and flipped on the shower The Lakeview General had a pretty good selection of wines tucked away in one corner  not much local demand for it maybe but the tourists probably bought a fair quantity  and I selected a bottle of Mondavi red It was probably a bit more expensive than Mattie had had in mind but I could peel the pricesticker off and hope she wouldnt know the difference There was a line at the checkout mostly folks with damp teeshirts pulled on over their bathing suits and sand from the public beach sticking to their legs While I was waiting my turn my eye happened on the impulse items which are always stocked near the counter Among them were several plastic bags labeled MAGNABET each bag showing a cartoon refrigerator with the message BACK SOON stuck to it According to the written info there were two sets of consonants in each Magnabet PLUS EXTRA VOWELS I grabbed two sets    then added a third thinking that Mattie Devores kid was probably just the right age for such an item Kyra saw me pulling into the weedy dooryard jumped off the slumpy little swingset beside the trailer bolted to her mother and hid behind her When I approached the hibachi which had been set up beside the cinderblock front steps the child whod spoken to me so fearlessly on Saturday was just a peeking blue eye and a chubby hand grasping a fold of her mothers sundress below the hip Two hours brought considerable changes however As twilight deepened Kyra sat on my lap in the trailers living room listening carefully  if with growing wooziness  as I read her the everenthralling story of Cinderella The couch we were on was a shade of brown which can by law only be sold in discount stores and extremely lumpy into the bargain but I still felt ashamed of my casual preconceptions about what I would find inside this trailer On the wall above and behind us there was an Edward Hopper print  that one of a lonely lunch counter late at night  and across the room over the small Formicatopped table in the kitchen nook was one of Vincent van Goghs Sunflowers Even more than the Hopper it looked at home in Mattie Devores doublewide I have no idea why that should have been true but it was Glass slipper will cut her footie Ki said in a muzzy considering way No way I said Slipperglass was specially made in the Kingdom of Grimoire Smooth and unbreakable as long as you didnt sing high C while wearing them I get a pair Sorry Ki I said no one knows how to make slipperglass anymore Its a lost art like Toledo steel It was hot in the trailer and she was hot against my shirt where her upper body lay but I wouldnt have changed it Having a kid on my lap was pretty great Outside her mother was singing and gathering up dishes from the card table wed used for our picnic Hearing her sing was also pretty great Go on go on Kyra said pointing to the picture of Cinderella scrubbing the floor The little girl peeking nervously around her mothers leg was gone the angry Imgoingtothedamnbeach girl of Saturday morning was gone here was only a sleepy kid who was pretty and bright and trusting Before I cant hold it anymore Do you need to go peepee No she said looking at me with some disdain Besides thats yourinating Peas are what you eat with meatloaf thats what Mattie says And I already went But if you dont go fast on the story Ill fall to sleep You cant hurry stories with magic in them Ki Well go as fast as you can Okay I turned the page Here was Cinderella trying to be a good sport waving goodbye to her asshole sisters as they went off to the ball dressed like starlets at a disco No sooner had Cinderella said goodbye to Tammy Faye and Vanna   Those are the sisters names The ones I made up for them yes Is that okay Sure She settled more comfortably on my lap and dropped her head against my chest again No sooner had Cinderella said goodbye to Tammy Faye and Vanna than a bright light suddenly appeared in the corner of the kitchen Stepping out of it was a beautiful lady in a silver gown The jewels in her hair glowed like stars Fairy godmother Kyra said matteroffactly Yes Mattie came in carrying the remaining halfbottle of Mondavi and the blackened barbecue implements Her sundress was bright red On her feet she wore lowtopped sneakers so white that they seemed to flash in the gloom Her hair was tied back and although she still wasnt the gorgeous countryclub babe I had briefly envisioned she was very pretty Now she looked at Kyra looked at me raised her eyebrows made a lifting gesture with her arms I shook my head sending back a message that neither of us was ready quite yet I resumed reading while Mattie went to work scrubbing her few cooking tools She was still humming By the time she had finished with the spatula Kis body had taken on an additional relaxation which I recognized at once  shed conked out and hard I closed the Little Golden Treasury of Fairy Tales and put it on the coffeetable beside a couple of other stacked books  whatever Mattie was reading I presumed I looked up saw her looking back at me from the kitchen and flicked her the VforVictory sign Noonan the winner by a technical knockout in the eighth round I said Mattie dried her hands on a dishtowel and came over Give her to me I stood up with Kyra in my arms instead Ill carry Where She pointed On the left I carried the baby down the hallway which was narrow enough so I had to be careful not to bump her feet on one side or the top of her head on the other At the end of the hall was the bathroom stringently clean On the right was a closed door which led I assumed into the bedroom Mattie had once shared with Lance Devore and where she now slept alone If there was a boyfriend who overnighted even some of the time Mattie had done a good job of erasing his presence from the trailer I slid carefully through the door on the left and looked at the little bed with its ruffled coverlet of cabbage roses the table with the dollhouse on it the picture of the Emerald City on one wall the sign done in shiny stickon letters on another one that read CASA KYRA Devore wanted to take her away from here a place where nothing was wrong  where to the contrary everything was perfectly right Casa Kyra was the room of a little girl who was growing up okay Put her on the bed and then go pour yourself another glass of wine Mattie said Ill zip her into her pjs and join you I know weve got stuff to talk about Okay I put her down then bent a little farther meaning to plant a kiss on her nose I almost thought better of it then did it anyway When I left Mattie was smiling so I guess it was okay I poured myself a little more wine walked back into the scrap of living room with it and looked at the two books beside Kis fairytale collection Im always curious about what people are reading the only better insight into them is the contents of their medicine cabinets and rummaging through your hosts drugs and nostrums is frowned upon by the better class The books were different enough to qualify as schizoid One with a playingcard bookmark about three quarters of the way through was the paperback edition of Richard North Pattersons Silent Witness I applauded her taste Patterson and DeMille are probably the best of the current popular novelists The other a hardcover tome of some weight was The Collected Short Works of Herman Melville About as far from Richard North Patterson as you could get According to the faded purple ink stamped on the thickness of the pages this volume belonged to Four Lakes Community Library That was a lovely little stone building about five miles south of Dark Score Lake where Route  passes off the TR and into Motton Where Mattie worked presumably I opened to her bookmark another playing card and saw she was reading Bartleby I dont understand that she said from behind me startling me so badly that I almost dropped the books I like it  its a good enough story  but I havent the slightest idea what it means The other one now Ive even figured out who did it Its a strange pair to read in tandem I said putting them back down The Patterson Im reading for pleasure Mattie said She went into the kitchen looked briefly and with some longing I thought at the bottle of wine then opened the fridge and took out a pitcher of KoolAid On the fridge door were words her daughter had already assembled from her Magnabet bag KI and MATTIE and HOHO Santa Claus I presumed Well Im reading them both for pleasure I guess but were due to discuss Bartleby in this little group Im a part of We meet Thursday nights at the library Ive still got about ten pages to go A readers circle Uhhuh Mrs Briggs leads She formed it long before I was born Shes the head librarian at Four Lakes you know I do Lindy Briggs is my caretakers sisterinlaw Mattie smiled Small world isnt it No its a big world but a small town She started to lean back against the counter with her glass of KoolAid then thought better of it Why dont we go outside and sit That way anyone passing can see that were still dressed and that we dont have anything on insideout I looked at her startled She looked back with a kind of cynical good humor It wasnt an expression that looked particularly at home on her face I may only be twentyone but Im not stupid she said Hes watching me I know it and you probably do too On another night I might be tempted to say fuck him if he cant take a joke but its cooler out there and the smoke from the hibachi will keep the worst of the bugs away Have I shocked you If so Im sorry You havent She had a little No need to apologize We carried our drinks down the notquitesteady cinderblock steps and sat sidebyside in a couple of lawnchairs To the left of us the coals in the hibachi glowed soft rose in the growing gloom Mattie leaned back placed the cold curve of her glass briefly against her forehead then drank most of what was left the ice cubes sliding against her teeth with a click and a rattle Crickets hummed in the woods behind the trailer and across the road Farther up Highway  I could see the bright white fluorescents over the gas island at the Lakeview General The seat of my chair was a little baggy the interwoven straps a little frayed and the old girl canted pretty severely to the left but there was still no place Id rather have been sitting just then This evening had turned out to be a quiet little miracle  at least so far We still had John Storrow to get to Im glad you came on a Tuesday she said Tuesday nights are hard for me Im always thinking of the ballgame down at Warringtons The guysll be picking up the gear by now  the bats and bases and catchers mask  and putting it back in the storage cabinet behind home plate Drinking their last beers and smoking their last cigarettes Thats where I met my husband you know Im sure youve been told all that by now I couldnt see her face clearly but I could hear the faint tinge of bitterness which had crept into her voice and guessed she was still wearing the cynical expression It was too old for her but I thought shed come by it honestly enough Although if she didnt watch out it would take root and grow I heard a version from Bill yes  Lindys brotherinlaw Oh ayuh  our storys on retail You can get it at the store or the Village Cafe or at that old blabbermouths garage    which my fatherinlaw rescued from Western Savings by the way He stepped in just before the bank could foreclose Now Dickie Brooks and his cronies think Max Devore is walking talking Jesus I hope you got a fairer version from Mr Dean than youd get at the AllPurpose You mustve or you wouldnt have risked eating hamburgers with Jezebel I wanted to get away from that if I could  her anger was understandable but useless Of course it was easier for me to see that it wasnt my kid who had been turned into the handkerchief tied at the center of a tugofwar rope They still play softball at Warringtons Even though Devore bought the place Yes indeed He goes down to the field in his motorized wheelchair every Tuesday evening and watches There are other things hes done since he came back here that are just attempts to buy the towns good opinion but I think he genuinely loves the softball games The Whitmore woman goes too Brings an extra oxygen tank along in a little red wheelbarrow with a whitewall tire on the front She keeps a fielders mitt in there too in case any foul pops come up over the backstop to where he sits He caught one near the start of the season I heard and got a standing O from the players and the folks who come to watch Going to the games puts him in touch with his son you think Mattie smiled grimly I dont think Lance so much as crosses his mind not when hes at the ballfield They play hard at Warringtons  slide into home with their feet up jump into the puckerbrush for the flyballs curse each other when they do something wrong  and thats what old Max Devore enjoys thats why he never misses a Tuesday evening game He likes to watch them slide and get up bleeding Is that how Lance played She thought about it carefully He played hard but he wasnt crazed He was there just for the fun of it We all were We women  shit really just us girls Barney Therriaults wife Cindy was only sixteen  wed stand behind the backstop on the firstbase side smoking cigarettes or waving punks to keep the bugs away cheering our guys when they did something good laughing when they did something stupid Wed swap sodas or share a can of beer Id admire Helen Gearys twins and shed kiss Ki under the chin until Ki giggled Sometimes wed go down to the Village Cafe afterward and Buddyd make us pizzas losers pay All friends again you know a ter the game Wed sit there laughing and yelling and blowing strawwrappers around some of the guys halfloaded but nobody mean In those days they got all the mean out on the ballfield And you know what None of them come to see me Not Helen Geary who was my best friend Not Richie Lattimore who was Lances best friend  the two of them would talk about rocks and birds and the kinds of trees there were across the lake for hours on end They came to the uneral and for a little while after and then    you know what it was like When I was a kid our well dried up For awhile youd get a trickle when you turned on the tap but then there was just air Just air The cynicism was gone and there was only hurt in her voice I saw Helen at Christmas and we promised to get together for the twins birthday but we never did I think shes scared to come near me Because of the old man Who else But thats okay life goes on She sat up drank the rest of her KoolAid and set the glass aside What about you Mike Did you come back to write a book Are you going to name the TR This was a local bon mot that I remembered with an almost painful twinge of nostalgia Locals with great plans were said to be bent on naming the TR No I said and then astonished myself by saying I dont do that anymore I think I expected her to leap to her feet overturning her chair and uttering a sharp cry of horrified denial All of which says a good deal about me I suppose and none of it flattering Youve retired she asked sounding calm and remarkably unhorrified Or is it writers block Well its certainly not chosen retirement I realized the conversation had taken a rather amusing turn Id come primarily to sell her on John Storrow  to shove John Storrow down her throat if that was what it took  and instead I was for the first time discussing my inability to work For the first time with anyone So its a block I used to think so but now Im not so sure I think novelists may come equipped with a certain number of stories to tell  theyre built into the software And when theyre gone theyre gone I doubt that she said Maybe youll write now that youre down here Maybe thats part of the reason you came back Maybe youre right Are you scared Sometimes Mostly about what Ill do for the rest of my life Im no good at boats in bottles and my wife was the one with the green thumb Im scared too she said Scared a lot All the time now it seems like That hell win his custody case Mattie thats what I   The custody case is only part of it she said Im scared just to be here on the TR It started early this summer long after I knew Devore meant to get Ki away from me if he could And its getting worse In a way its like watching thunderheads gather over New Hampshire and then come piling across the lake I cant put it any better than that except     She shifted crossing her legs and then bending forward to pull the skirt of her dress against the line of her shin as if she were cold Except that Ive woken up several times lately sure that I wasnt in the bedroom alone Once when I was sure I wasnt in the bed alone Sometimes its just a feeling  like a headache only in your nerves  and sometimes I think I can hear whispering or crying I made a cake one night  about two weeks ago this was  and forgot to put the flour away The next morning the cannister was overturned and the flour was spilled on the counter Someone had written hello in it I thought at first it was Ki but she said she didnt do it Besides it wasnt her printing hers is all straggly I dont know if she could even write hello Hi maybe but    Mike you dont think he could be sending someone around to try and freak me out do you I mean thats just stupid right I dont know I said I thought of something thumping the insulation in the dark as I stood on the stairs I thought of hello printed with magnets on my refrigerator door and a child sobbing in the dark My skin felt more than cold it felt numb A headache in the nerves that was good that was exactly how you felt when something reached around the wall of the real world and touched you on the nape of the neck Maybe its ghosts she said and smiled in an uncertain way that was more frightened than amused I opened my mouth to tell her about what had been happening at Sara Laughs then closed it again There was a clear choice to be made here either we could be sidetracked into a discussion of the paranormal or we could come back to the visible world The one where Max Devore was trying to steal himself a kid Yeah I said The spirits are about to speak I wish I could see your face better There was something on it just then What I dont know I said But right now I think wed better talk about Kyra Okay Okay In the faint glow of the hibachi I could see her settling herself in her chair as if to take a blow Ive been subpoenaed to give a deposition in Castle Rock on Friday Before Elmer Durgin who is Kyras guardian ad litem   That pompous little toad isnt Kis anything she burst out Hes in my fatherinlaws hip pocket just like Dickie Osgood old Maxs pet realestate guy Dickie and Elmer Durgin drink together down at The Mellow Tiger or at least they did until this business really got going Then someone probably told them it would look bad and they stopped The papers were served by a deputy named George Footman Just one more of the usual suspects Mattie said in a thin voice Dickie Osgoods a snake but George Footmans a junkyard dog Hes been suspended off the cops twice Once more and he can work for Max Devore fulltime Well he scared me I tried not to show it but he did And people who scare me make me angry I called my agent in New York and then hired a lawyer One who makes a specialty of childcustody cases I tried to see how she was taking this and couldnt although we were sitting fairly close together But she still had that set look like a woman who expects to take some hard blows Or perhaps for Mattie the blows had already started to fall Slowly not allowing myself to rush I went through my conversation with John Storrow I emphasized what Storrow had said about sexual equality  that it was apt to be a negative force in her case making it easier for Judge Rancourt to take Kyra away I also came down hard on the fact that Devore could have all the lawyers he wanted  not to mention sympathetic witnesses with Richard Osgood running around the TR and spreading Devores dough  but that the court wasnt obligated to treat her to so much as an ice cream cone I finished by telling her that John wanted to talk to one of us tomorrow at eleven and that it should be her Then I waited The silence spun out broken only by crickets and the faint revving of some kids unmuffled truck Up Route  the white fluorescents went out as the Lakeview Market finished another day of summer trade I didnt like Matties quiet it seemed like the prelude to an explosion A Yankee explosion I held my peace and waited for her to ask me what gave me the right to meddle in her business When she finally spoke her voice was low and defeated It hurt to hear her sounding that way but like the cynical look on her face earlier it wasnt surprising And I hardened myself against it as best I could Hey Mattie tough old world Pick one Why would you do this she asked Why would you hire an expensive New York lawyer to take my case That is what youre offering isnt it Its got to be because I sure cant hire him I got thirty thousand dollars insurance money when Lance died and was lucky to get that It was a policy he bought from one of his Warringtons friends almost as a joke but without it I would have lost the trailer last winter They may love Dickie Brooks at Western Savings but they dont give a rats ass for Mattie Stanchfield Devore After taxes I make about a hundred a week at the library So youre offering to pay Right Right Why You dont even know us Because     I trailed off I seem to remember wanting Jo to step in at that point asking my mind to supply her voice which I could then pass on to Mattie in my own But Jo didnt come I was flying solo Because now I do nothing that makes a difference I said at last and once again the words astonished me And I do know you Ive eaten your food Ive read Ki a story and had her fall asleep in my lap    and maybe I saved her life the other day when I grabbed her out of the road Well never know for sure but maybe I did You know what the Chinese say about something like that I didnt expect an answer the question was more rhetorical than real but she surprised me Not for the last time either That if you save someones life youre responsible for them Yes Its also about whats fair and whats right but I think mostly its about wanting to be part of something where I make a difference I look back on the four years since my wife died and theres nothing there Not even a book where Marjorie the shy typist meets a handsome stranger She sat thinking this over watching as a fully loaded pulptruck snored past on the highway its headlights glaring and its load of logs swaying from side to side like the hips of an overweight woman Dont you root for us she said at last She spoke in a low unexpectedly fierce voice Dont you root for us like he roots for his teamoftheweek down at the softball field I need help and I know it but I wont have that I cant have it Were not a game Ki and me You understand Perfectly You know what people in town will say dont you Yes Im a lucky girl dont you think First I marry the son of an extremely rich man and after he dies I fall under the protective wing of another rich guy Next Ill probably move in with Donald Trump Cut it out Id probably believe it myself if I were on the other side But I wonder if anyone notices that lucky Mattie is still living in a Modair trailer and cant afford health insurance Or that her kid got most of her vaccinations from the County Nurse My parents died when I was fifteen I have a brother and a sister but theyre both a lot older and both out of state My parents were drunks  not physically abusive but there was plenty of the other kinds It was like growing up in a    a roach motel My dad was a pulper my mom was a bourbon beautician whose one ambition was to own a Mary Kay pink Cadillac He drowned in Kewadin Pond She drowned in her own vomit about six months later How do you like it so far Not very much Im sorry After Moms funeral my brother Hugh offered to take me back to Rhode Island but I could tell his wife wasnt exactly nuts about having a fifteenyearold join the family and I cant say that I blamed her Also Id just made the jv cheering squad That seems like supreme diddlyshit now but it was a very big deal then Of course it had been a big deal especially to the child of alcoholics The only one still living at home Being that last child watching as the disease really digs its claws in can be one of the worlds loneliest jobs Last one out of the sacred ginmill please turn off the lights I ended up going to live with my aunt Florence just two miles down the road It took us about three weeks to discover we didnt like each other very much but we made it work for two years Then between my junior and senior years I got a summer job at Warringtons and met Lance When he asked me to marry him Aunt Flo refused to give permission When I told her I was pregnant she emancipated me so I didnt need it You dropped out of school She grimaced nodded I didnt want to spend six months having people watch me swell up like a balloon Lance supported me He said I could take the equivalency test I did last year It was easy And now Ki and I are on our own Even if my aunt agreed to help me what could she do She works in the Castle Rock GoreTex factory and makes about sixteen thousand dollars a year I nodded again thinking that my last check for French royalties had been about that My last quarterly check Then I remembered something Ki had told me on the day I met her When I was carrying Kyra out of the road she said that if you were mad shed go to her white nana If your folks are dead who did she   Except I didnt really have to ask I only had to make one or two simple connections Rogette Whitmores the white nana Devores assistant But that means     That Kis been with them Yes you bet Until late last month I allowed her to visit her grandpa  and Rogette by association of course  quite often Once or twice a week and sometimes for an overnight She likes her Whita poppa  at least she did at first  and she absolutely adores that creepy woman I thought Mattie shivered in the gloom although the night was still very warm Devore called to say he was coming east for Lances funeral and to ask if he could see his granddaughter while he was here Nice as pie he was just as if hed never tried to buy me off when Lance told him we were going to get married Did he Uhhuh The first offer was a hundred thousand That was in August of  after Lance called him to say we were getting married in midSeptember I kept quiet about it A week later the offer went up to two hundred thousand For what precisely To remove my bitchhooks and relocate with no forwarding address This time I did tell Lance and he hit the roof Called his old man and said we were going to be married whether he liked it or not Told him that if he ever wanted to see his grandchild he had better cut the shit and behave With another parent I thought that was probably the most reasonable response Lance Devore could have made I respected him for it The only problem was that he wasnt dealing with a reasonable man he was dealing with the fellow who as a child had stolen Scooter Larribees new sled These offers were made by Devore himself over the telephone Both when Lance wasnt around Then about ten days before the wedding I had a visit from Dickie Osgood I was to make a call to a number in Delaware and when I did     Mattie shook her head You wouldnt believe it Its like something out of one of your books May I guess If you want He tried to buy the child He tried to buy Kyra Her eyes widened A scantling moon had come up and I could see that look of surprise well enough How much I asked Im curious How much for you to give birth leave Devores grandchild with Lance then scat Two million dollars she whispered Deposited in the bank of my choice as long as it was west of the Mississippi and I signed an agreement to stay away from her  and from Lance  until at least April twentieth  The year Ki turns twentyone Yes And Osgood doesnt know any of the details so Devores skirts remain clean here in town Uhhuh And the two million was only the start There was to be an additional million on Kis fifth tenth fifteenth and twentieth birthdays She shook her head in a disbelieving way The linoleum keeps bubbling up in the kitchen the showerhead keeps falling into the tub and the whole damn rig cants to the east these days but I could have been the sixmilliondollar woman Did you ever consider taking the off Mattie I wondered    but that was a question Id never ask a sign of curiosity so unseemly it deserved no satisfaction Did you tell Lance I tried not to He was already furious with his father and I didnt want to make it worse I didnt want that much hate at the start of our marriage no matter how good the reasons for hating might be    and I didnt want Lance to    later on with me you know     She raised her hands then dropped them back on her thighs The gesture was both weary and oddly endearing You didnt want Lance turning on you ten years later and saying You came between me and my father you bitch Something like that But in the end I couldnt keep it to myself I was just this kid from the sticks didnt own a pair of pantyhose until I was eleven wore my hair in nothing but braids or a ponytail until I was thirteen thought the whole state of New York was New York City    and this guy    this phantom father    had offered me six million bucks It terrified me I had dreams about him coming in the night like a troll and stealing my baby out of her crib Hed come wriggling through the window like a snake     Dragging his oxygen tank behind him no doubt She smiled I didnt know about the oxygen then Or Rogette Whitmore either All Im trying to say is that I was only seventeen and not good at keeping secrets I had to restrain my own smile at the way she said this  as if decades of experience now lay between that naive frightened child and this mature woman with the mailorder diploma Lance was angry So angry he replied to his father by email instead of calling He stuttered you see and the more upset he was the worse his stutter became A phone conversation would have been impossible Now at last I thought I had a clear picture Lance Devore had written his father an unthinkable letter  unthinkable that was if you happened to be Max Devore The letter said that Lance didnt want to hear from his father again and Mattie didnt either He wouldnt be welcome in their home the Modair trailer wasnt quite the humble woodcutters cottage of a Brothers Grimm tale but it was close enough for kissing He wouldnt be welcome to visit following the birth of their baby and if he had the gall to send the child a present then or later it would be returned Stay out of my life Dad This time youve gone too far to forgive There are undoubtedly diplomatic ways of handling an offended child some wise and some crafty    but ask yourself this would a diplomatic father have gotten himself into such a situation to begin with Would a man with even minimal insight into human nature have offered his sons fiancee a bounty one so enormous it probably had little real sense or meaning to her to give up her firstborn child And hed offered this devils bargain to a girlwoman of seventeen an age when the romantic view of life is at absolute high tide If nothing else Devore should have waited awhile before making his final offer You could argue that he didnt know if he had awhile but it wouldnt be a persuasive argument I thought Mattie was right  deep in that wrinkled old prune which served him as a heart Max Devore thought he was going to live forever In the end he hadnt been able to restrain himself There was the sled he wanted the sled he just had to have on the other side of the window All he had to do was break the glass and take it Hed been doing it all his life and so he had reacted to his sons email not craftily as a man of his years and abilities should have done but furiously as the child would have done if the glass in the shed window had proved immune to his hammering fists Lance didnt want him meddling Fine Lance could live with his backwoods Daisy Mae in a tent or a trailer or a goddamned cowbarn He could give up the cushy surveying job as well and find real employment See how the other half lived In other words you cant quit on me son Youre fired We didnt fall into each others arms at the funeral Mattie said dont get that idea But he was decent to me  which I didnt expect  and I tried to be decent to him He offered me a stipend which I refused I was afraid there might be legal ramifications I doubt it but I like your caution What happened when he saw Kyra for the first time Mattie Do you remember Ill never forget it She reached into the pocket of her dress found a battered pack of cigarettes and shook one out She looked at it with a mixture of greed and disgust I quit these because Lance said we couldnt really afford them and I knew he was right But the habit creeps back I only smoke a pack a week and I know damned well even thats too much but sometimes I need the comfort Do you want one I shook my head She lit up and in the momentary flare of the match her face was way past pretty What had the old man made of her I wondered He met his granddaughter for the first time beside a hearse Mattie said We were at Dakins Funeral Home in Motton It was the viewing Do you know about that Oh yes I said thinking of Jo The casket was closed but they still call it a viewing Weird I came out to have a cigarette I told Ki to sit on the funeral parlor steps so she wouldnt get the smoke and I went a little way down the walk This big gray limo pulled up Id never seen anything like it before except on TV I knew who it was right away I put my cigarettes back in my purse and told Ki to come She toddled down the walk and took hold of my hand The limo door opened and Rogette Whitmore got out She had an oxygen mask in one hand but he didnt need it at least not then He got out after her A tall man  not as tall as you Mike but tall  wearing a gray suit and black shoes as shiny as mirrors She paused thinking Her cigarette rose briefly to her mouth then went back down to the arm of her chair a red firefly in the weak moonlight At first he didnt say anything The woman tried to take his arm and help him climb the three or four steps from the road to the walk but he shook her off He got to where we were standing under his own power although I could hear him wheezing way down deep in his chest It was the sound a machine makes when it needs oil I dont know how much he can walk now but its probably not much Those few steps pretty well did him in and that was almost a year ago He looked at me for a second or two then bent forward with his big bony old hands on his knees He looked at Kyra and she looked up at him Yes I could see it    except not in color not in an image like a photograph I saw it as a woodcut just one more harsh illustration from Grimms Fairy Tales The little girl looks up wideeyed at the rich old man  once a boy who went triumphantly sliding on a stolen sled now at the other end of his life and just one more bag of bones In my imagining Ki was wearing a hooded jacket and Devores grandpa mask was slightly askew allowing me to see the tufted wolfpelt beneath What big eyes you have Grandpa what a big nose you have Grandpa what big teeth you have too He picked her up I dont know how much effort it cost him but he did And  the oddest thing  Ki let herself be picked up He was a complete stranger to her and old people always seem to scare little children but she let him pick her up Do you know who I am he asked her She shook her head but the way she was looking at him    it was as if she almost knew Do you think thats possible Yes He said Im your grandpa And I almost grabbed her back Mike because I had this crazy idea    I dont know     That he was going to eat her up Her cigarette paused in front of her mouth Her eyes were round How do you know that How can you know that Because in my minds eye it looks like a fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood and the Old Gray Wolf What did he do then Ate her up with his eyes Since then hes taught her to play checkers and Candyland and boxdots Shes only three but hes taught her to add and subtract She has her own room at Warringtons and her own little computer in it and God knows what hes taught her to do with that    but that first time he only looked at her It was the hungriest look Ive ever seen in my life And she looked back It couldnt have been more than ten or twenty seconds but it seemed like forever Then he tried to hand her back to me Hed used up all his strength though and if I hadnt been right there to take her I think he would have dropped her on the cement walk He staggered a little and Rogette Whitmore put an arm around him That was when he took the oxygen mask from her  there was a little airbottle attached to it on an elastic  and put it over his mouth and nose A couple of deep breaths and he seemed more or less all right again He gave it back to Rogette and really seemed to see me for the first time He said Ive been a fool havent I I said Yes sir I think you have He gave me a look very black when I said that I think if hed been even five years younger he might have hit me for it But he wasnt and he didnt No He said I want to go inside Will you help me do that I said I would We went up the mortuary steps with Rogette on one side of him me t sort of like a harem girl It wasnt a very nice feeling When we got into the vestibule he sat down to catch his breath and take a little more oxygen Rogette turned to Kyra I think that womans got a scary face it reminds me of some painting or other   The Cry The one by Munch Im pretty sure thats the one She dropped her cigarette  shed smoked it all the way down to the filter  and stepped on it grinding it into the bony rockriddled ground with one white sneaker But Ki wasnt scared of her a bit Not then not later She bent down to Kyra and said What rhymes with lady and Kyra said Shady right off Even at two she loved rhymes Rogette reached into her purse and brought out a Hersheys Kiss Ki looked at me to see if she had permission and I said All right but just one and I dont want to see any of it on your dress Ki popped it into her mouth and smiled at Rogette as if theyd been friends since forever By then Devore had his breath back but he looked tired  the most tired man Ive ever seen He reminded me of something in the Bible about how in the days of our old age we say we have no pleasure in them My heart kind of broke for him Maybe he saw it because he reached for my hand He said Dont shut me out And at that moment I could see Lance in his face I started to cry I said I wont unless you make me I could see them there in the funeral homes foyer him sitting her standing the little girl looking on in wideeyed puzzlement as she sucked the sweet Hersheys Kiss Canned organ music in the background Poor old Max Devore had been crafty enough on the day of his sons viewing I thought Dont shut me out indeed I tried to buy you off and when that didnt work I upped the stakes and tried to buy the baby When that also failed I told my son that you and he and my grandchild could choke on the dirt of your own decision In a way Im the reason he was where he was when fell and broke his neck but dont shut me out Mattie Im just a poor old geezer so dont shut me out I was stupid wasnt I You expected him to be better than he was If that makes you stupid Mattie the world could use more of it I did have my doubts she said Its why I wouldnt take any of his money and by last October hed quit asking But I let him see her I suppose yeah part of it was the idea there might be something in it for Ki later on but I honestly didnt think about that so much Mostly it was him being her only blood link to her father I wanted her to enjoy that the way any kid enjoys having a grandparent What I didnt want was for her to be infected by all the crap that went on before Lance died At first it seemed to be working Then little by little things changed I realized that Ki didnt like her white poppa so much for one thing Her feelings about Rogette are the same but Max Devores started to make her nervous in some way I dont understand and she cant explain I asked her once if hed ever touched her anywhere that made her feel funny I showed her the places I meant and she said no I believe her but    he said something or did something Im almost sure of it Could be no more than the sound of his breathing getting worse I said That alone might be enough to scare a child Or maybe he had some kind of spell while she was there What about you Mattie Well    one day in February Lindy Briggs told me that George Footman had been in to check the fire extinguishers and the smoke detectors in the library He also asked if Lindy had found any beer cans or liquor bottles in the trash lately Or cigarette butts that were obviously homemade Roaches in other words Uhhuh And Dickie Osgood has been visiting my old friends I hear Chatting Panning for gold Digging the dirt Is there any to dig Not much thank God I hoped she was right and I hoped that if there was stuff she wasnt telling me John Storrow would get it out of her But through all this you let Ki go on seeing him What would pulling the plug on the visits have accomplished And I thought that allowing them to go on would at least keep him from speeding up any plans he might have That I thought made a lonely kind of sense Then in the spring I started to get some extremely creepy scary feelings Creepy how Scary how I dont know She took out her cigarettes looked at them then stuffed the pack back in her pocket It wasnt just that my fatherinlaw was looking for dirty laundry in my closets either It was Ki I started to worry about ICI all the time she was with him    with them Rogette would come in the BMW theyd bought or leased and Ki would be sitting out on the steps waiting for her With her bag of toys if it was a dayvisit with her little pink Minnie Mouse suitcase if it was an overnight And shed always come back with one more thing than she left with My fatherinlaws a great believer in presents Before popping her into the car Rogette would give me that cold little smile of hers and say Seven oclock then well give her supper or Eight oclock then and a nice hot breakfast before she leaves Id say okay and then Rogette would reach into her bag and hold out a Hersheys Kiss to Ki just the way youd hold a biscuit out to a dog to make it shake hands Shed say a word and Kyra would rhyme it Rogette would toss her her treat  woofwoof good dog I always used to think  and off theyd go Come seven in the evening or eight in the morning the BMW would pull in right where your cars parked now You could set your clock by the woman But I got worried That they might get tired of the legal process and just snatch her This seemed to me a reasonable concern  so reasonable I could hardly believe Mattie had ever let her little girl go to the old man in the first place In custody cases as in the rest of life possession tends to be nine tenths of the law and if Mattie was telling the truth about her past and present a custody hearing was apt to turn into a tiresome production even for the rich Mr Devore Snatching might in the end look like a more efficient solution Not exactly she said I guess its the logical thing but that wasnt really it I just got afraid There was nothing I could put my finger on It would get to be quarter past six in the evening and Id think This time that whitehaired bitch isnt going to bring her back This time shes going to     I waited When nothing came I said Going to what I told you I dont know she said But Ive been afraid for Ki since spring By the time June came around I couldnt stand it anymore and I put a stop to the visits Kyras been offandon pissed at me ever since Im pretty sure thats most of what that Fourth of July escapade was about She doesnt talk about her grandfather very much but shes always popping out with What do you think the white nanas doing now Mattie or Do you think the white nana would like my new dress Or shell run up to me and say Sing ring king thing and ask for a treat What was the reaction from Devore Complete fury He called again and again first asking what was wrong then making threats Physical threats Custody threats He was going to take her away when he was finished with me Id stand before the whole world as an unfit mother I didnt have a chance my only hope was to relent and let me see my granddaughter goddammit I nodded Please dont shut me out doesnt sound like the guy who called while I was watching the fireworks but that does Ive also gotten calls from Dickie Osgood and a number of other locals she said Including Lances old friend Richie Lattimore Richie said I wasnt being true to Lances memory What about George Footman He cruises by once in awhile Lets me know hes watching He hasnt called or stopped in You asked about physical threats  just seeing Footmans cruiser on my road feels like a physical threat to me He scares me But these days it seems as if everything does Even though Kyras visits have stopped Even though It feels    thundery Like somethings going to happen And every day that feeling seems to get stronger John Storrows number I said Do you want it She sat quietly looking into her lap Then she raised her head and nodded Give it to me And thank you From the bottom of my heart I had the number on a pink memoslip in my front pocket She grasped it but did not immediately take it Our fingers were touching and she was looking at me with disconcerting steadiness It was as if she knew more about my motives than I did myself What can I do to repay you she asked and there it was Tell Storrow everything youve told me I let go of the pink slip and stood up Thatll do just fine And now I have to get along Will you call and tell me how you made out with him Of course We walked to my car I turned to her when we got there For a moment I thought she was going to put her arms around me and hug me a thankyou gesture that might have led anywhere in our current mood  one so heightened it was almost melodramatic But it was a melodramatic situation a fairytale where theres good and bad and a lot of repressed sex running under both Then headlights appeared over the brow of the hill where the market stood and swept past the AllPurpose Garage They moved toward us brightening Mattie stood back and actually put her hands behind her like a child who has been scolded The car passed leaving us in the dark again    but the moment had passed too If there had been a moment Thanks for dinner I said It was wonderful Thanks for the lawyer Im sure hell be wonderful too she said and we both laughed The electricity went out of the air He spoke of you once you know Devore I looked at her in surprise Im amazed he even knew who I was Before this I mean He knows all right He spoke of you with what I think was genuine affection Youre kidding You must be Im not He said that your greatgrandfather and his greatgrandfather worked the same camps and were neighbors when they werent in the woods  I think he said not far from where Boyds Marina is now They shit in the same pit is the way he put it Charming huh He said he guessed that if a couple of loggers from the TR could produce millionaires the system was working the way it was supposed to Even if it took three generations to do it he said At the time I took it as a veiled criticism of Lance Its ridiculous however he meant it I said My family is from the coast Prouts Neck Other side of the state My dad was a fisherman and so was his father before him My greatgrandfather too They trapped lobsters and threw nets they didnt cut trees All that was true and yet my mind tried to fix on something Some memory connected to what she was saying Perhaps if I slept on it it would come back to me Could he have been talking about someone in your wifes family Nope There are Arlens in Maine  theyre a big family  but most are still in Massachusetts They do all sorts of things now but if you go back to the eighteeneighties the majority would have been quarrymen and stonecutters in the MaldenLynn area Devore was pulling your leg Mattie But even then I suppose I knew he wasnt He might have gotten some part of the story wrong  even the sharpest guys begin to lose the edge of their recollection by the time they turn eightyfive  but Max Devore wasnt much of a legpuller I had an image of unseen cables stretching beneath the surface of the earth here on the TR  stretching in all directions unseen but very powerful My hand was resting on top of my car door and now she touched it briefly Can I ask you one other question before you go Its stupid I warn you Go ahead Stupid questions are a specialty of mine Do you have any idea at all what that Bartleby story is about I wanted to laugh but there was enough moonlight for me to see she was serious and that Id hurt her feelings if I did She was a member of Lindy Briggss readers circle where I had once spoken in the late eighties probably the youngest by at least twenty years and she was afraid of appearing stupid I have to speak first next time she said and Id like to give more than just a summary of the story so they know Ive read it Ive thought about it until my head aches and I just dont see I doubt if its one of those stories where everything comes magically clear in the last few pages either And I feel like I should see  that its right there in front of me That made me think of the cables again  cables running in every direction a subcutaneous webwork connecting people and places You couldnt see them but you could feel them Especially if you tried to get away Meanwhile Mattie was waiting looking at me with hope and anxiety Okay listen up schools in session I said I am Believe me Most critics think Huckleberry Finn is the first modern American novel and thats fair enough but if Bartleby were a hundred pages longer I think Id put my money there Do you know what a scrivener was A secretary Thats too grand A copyist Sort of like Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol Only Dickens gives Bob a past and a family life Melville gives Bartleby neither Hes the first existential character in American fiction a guy with no ties    no ties to you know     A couple of loggers who could produce millionaires They shit in the same pit Mike What Are you okay Sure I focused my mind as best I could Bartleby is tied to life only by work In that way hes a twentiethcentury American type not much different from Sloan Wilsons Man in the Gray Flannel Suit or  in the dark version  Michael Corleone in The Godfather But then Bartleby begins to question even work the god of middleclass American males She looked excited now and I thought it was a shame shed missed her last year of high school For her and also for her teachers Thats why he starts saying I prefer not to Yes Think of Bartleby as a    a hotair balloon Only one rope still tethers him to the earth and that rope is his scrivening We can measure the rot in that last rope by the steadily increasing number of things Bartleby prefers not to do Finally the rope breaks and Bartleby floats away Its a goddam disturbing story isnt it One night I dreamed about him she said I opened the trailer door and there he was sitting on the steps in his old black suit Thin Not much hair I said Will you move please I have to go out and hang the clothes now And he said I prefer not to Yes I guess you could call it disturbing Then it still works I said and got into my car Call me Tell me how it goes with John Storrow I will And anything I can do to repay just ask Just ask How young did you have to be how beautifully ignorant to issue that kind of blank check My window was open I reached through it and squeezed her hand She squeezed back and hard You miss your wife a lot dont you she said It shows Sometimes She was no longer squeezing but she was still holding my hand When you were reading to Ki you looked both happy and sad at the same time I only saw her once your wife but I thought she was very beautiful I had been thinking about the touch of our hands concentrating on that Now I forgot about it entirely When did you see her And where Do you remember She smiled as if those were very silly questions I remember It was at the ballfield on the night I met my husband Very slowly I withdrew my hand from hers So far as I knew neither Jo nor I had been near TR all that summer of     but what I knew was apparently wrong Jo had been down on a Tuesday in early July She had even gone to the softball game Are you sure it was Jo I asked Mattie was looking off toward the road It wasnt my wife she was thinking about I would have bet the house and lot on it  either house either lot It was Lance Maybe that was good If she was thinking about him she probably wouldnt look too closely at me and I didnt think I had much control of my expression just then She might have seen more on my face than I wanted to show Yes she said I was standing with Jenna McCoy and Helen Geary  this was after Lance helped me with a keg of beer I got stuck in the mud and then asked if I was going for pizza with the rest of them after the game  and Jenna said Look its Mrs Noonan and Helen said Shes the writers wife Mattie isnt that a cool blouse The blouse was all covered with blue roses I remembered it very well Jo liked it because it was a joke  there are no blue roses not in nature and not in cultivation Once when she was wearing it she had thrown her arms extravagantly around my neck swooned her hips forward against mine and cried that she was my blue rose and I must stroke her until she turned pink Remembering that hurt and badly She was over on the thirdbase side behind the chickenwire screen Mattie said with some guy who was wearing an old brown jacket with patches on the elbows They were laughing together over something and then she turned her head a little and looked right at me She was quiet for a moment standing there beside my car in her red dress She raised her hair off the back of her neck held it then let it drop again Right at me Really seeing me And she had a look about her    shed just been laughing but this look was sad somehow It was as if she knew me Then the guy put his arm around her waist and they walked away Silence except for the crickets and the faroff drone of a truck Mattie only stood there for a moment as if dreaming with her eyes open and then she felt something and looked back at me Is something wrong No Except who was this guy with his arm around my wife She laughed a little uncertainly Well I doubt if he was her boyfriend you know He was quite a bit older Fifty at least So what I thought I myself was forty but that didnt mean I had missed the way Mattie moved inside her dress or lifted her hair from the nape of her neck I mean    youre kidding right I dont really know Theres a lot of things I dont know these days it seems But the ladys dead in any case so how can it matter Mattie was looking distressed If I put my foot in something Mike Im sorry Who was the man Do you know She shook her head I thought he was a summer person  there was that feeling about him maybe just because he was wearing a jacket on a hot summer evening  but if he was he wasnt staying at Warringtons I knew most of them And they walked off together Yes Sounding reluctant Toward the parking lot Yes More reluctant still And this time she was lying I knew it with a queer certainty that went far beyond intuition it was almost like mindreading I reached through the window and took her hand again You said if I could think of anything you could do to repay me to just ask Im asking Tell me the truth Mattie She bit her lip looking down at my hand lying over hers Then she looked up at my face He was a burly guy The old sportcoat made him look a little like a college professor but he could have been a carpenter for all I know His hair was black He had a tan They had a laugh together a good one and then she looked at me and the laugh went out of her face After that he put an arm around her and they walked away She paused Not toward the parking lot though Toward The Street The Street From there they could have walked north along the edge of the lake until they came to Sara Laughs And then Who knew She never told me she came down here that summer I said Mattie seemed to try several responses and find none of them to her liking I gave her her hand back It was time for me to go In fact I had started to wish Id left five minutes sooner Mike Im sure   No I said Youre not Neither am I But I loved her a lot and Im going to try and let this go It probably signifies nothing and besides  what else can I do Thanks for dinner Youre welcome Mattie looked so much like crying that I picked her hand up again and kissed the back of it I feel like a dope Youre not a dope I said I gave her hand another kiss then drove away And that was my date the first one in four years Driving home I thought of an old saying about how one person can never truly know another Its easy to give that idea lip service but its a jolt  as horrible and unexpected as severe air turbulence on a previously calm airline flight  to discover its a literal fact in ones own life I kept remembering our visit to a fertility doc after wed been trying to make a baby for almost two years with no success The doctor had told us I had a low sperm count  not disastrously low but down enough to account for Jos failure to conceive If you want a kid youll likely have one without any special help the doc had said Both the odds and time are still on your side It could happen tomorrow or it could happen four years from now Will you ever fill the house with babies Probably not But you might have two and youll almost certainly have one if you keep doing the thing that makes them She had grinned Remember the pleasure is in the journey There had been a lot of pleasure all right many ringings of Bunters bell but there had been no baby Then Johanna had died running across a shoppingcenter parking lot on a hot day and one of the items in her bag had been a Norco Home Pregnancy Test which she had not told me she had intended to buy No more than shed told me she had bought a couple of plastic owls to keep the crows from shitting on the lakeside deck What else hadnt she told me Stop I muttered For Christs sake stop thinking about it But I couldnt When I got back to Sara the fruit and vegetable magnets on the refrigerator were in a circle again Three letters had been clustered in the middle g d o I moved the o up to where I thought it belonged making god or maybe an abridged version of good Which meant exactly what I could speculate about that but I prefer not to I told the empty house I looked at Bunter the moose willing the bell around his motheaten neck to ring When it didnt I opened my two new Magnabet packages and stuck the letters on the fridge door spreading them out Then I went down to the north wing undressed and brushed my teeth As I bared my fangs for the mirror in a sudsy cartoon scowl I considered calling Ward Hankins again tomorrow morning I could tell him that my search for the elusive plastic owls had progressed from November of  to July of  What meetings had Jo put on her calendar for that month What excuses to be out of Derry And once I had finished with Ward I could tackle Jos friend Bonnie Amudson ask her if anything had been going on with Jo in the last summer of her life Let her rest in peace why dont you It was the UFO voice What good will it do you to do otherwise Assume she popped over to the TR after one of her board meetings maybe just on a whim met an old friend took him back to the house for a bite of dinner Just dinner And never told me I asked the UFO voice spitting out a mouthful of toothpaste and then rinsing Never said a single word How do you know she didnt the voice returned and that froze me in the act of putting my toothbrush back in the medicine cabinet The UFO voice had a point I had been deep into All the Way from the Top by July of  Jo could have come in and told me shed seen Lon Chaney Junior dancing with the queen doing the Werewolves of London and I probably would have said Uhhuh honey thats nice as I went on proofing copy Bullshit I said to my reflection Thats just bullshit Except it wasnt When I was really driving on a book I more or less fell out of the world other than a quick scan of the sports pages I didnt even read the newspaper So yes  it was possible that Jo had told me shed run over to the TR after a board meeting in Lewiston or Freeport it was possible that shed told me shed run into an old friend  perhaps another student from the photography seminar shed attended at Bates in   and it was possible shed told me theyd had dinner together on our deck eating black trumpet mushrooms shed picked herself as the sun went down It was possible shed told me these things and I hadnt registered a word of what she was saying And did I really think Id get anything I could trust out of Bonnie Amudson Shed been Jos friend not mine and Bonnie might feel the statute of limitations hadnt run out on any secrets my wife had told her The bottom line was as simple as it was brutal Jo was four years dead Best to love her and let all troubling questions lapse I took a final mouthful of water directly from the tap swished it around in my mouth and spat it out When I returned to the kitchen to set the coffeemaker for seven AM I saw a new message in a new circle of magnets It read blue rose liar ha ha I looked at it for a second or two wondering what had put it there and why Wondering if it was true I stretched out a hand and scattered all the letters far and wide Then I went to bed I caught the measles when I was eight and I was very ill I thought you were going to die my father told me once and he was not a man given to exaggeration He told me about how he and my mother had dunked me in a tub of cold water one night both of them at least halfconvinced the shock of it would stop my heart but both of them completely convinced that Id burn up before their eyes if they didnt do something I had begun to speak in a loud monotonously discursive voice about the bright figures I saw in the room angels come to bear me away my terrified mother was sure  and the last time my father took my temperature before the cold plunge he said that the mercury on the old Johnson  Johnson rectal thermometer had stood at a hundred and six degrees After that he said he didnt dare take it anymore I dont remember any bright figures but I remember a strange period of time that was like being in a funhouse corridor where several different movies were showing at once The world grew elastic bulging in places where it had never bulged before wavering in places where it had always been solid People  most of them seeming impossibly talldarted in and out of my room on scissoring cartoonish legs Their words all came out booming with instant echoes Someone shook a pair of babyshoes in my face I seem to remember my brother Siddy sticking his hand into his shirt and making repeated armfart noises Continuity broke down Everything came in segments weird wieners on a poison string In the years between then and the summer I returned to Sara Laughs I had the usual sicknesses infections and insults to the body but never anything like that feverish interlude when I was eight I never expected to  believing I suppose that such experiences are unique to children people with malaria or maybe those suffering catastrophic mental breakdowns But on the night of July seventh and the morning of July eighth I lived through a period of time remarkably like that childhood delirium Dreaming waking moving  they were all one Ill tell you as best I can but nothing I say can convey the strangeness of that experience It was as if I had found a secret passage hidden just beyond the wall of the world and went crawling along it First there was music Not Dixieland because there were no horns but like Dixieland A primitive reeling kind of bebop Three or four acoustic guitars a harmonica a standup bass or maybe a pair Behind all of this was a hard happy drumming that didnt sound as if it was coming from a real drum it sounded as if someone with a lot of percussive talent was whopping on a bunch of boxes Then a womans voice joined in  a contralto voice not quite mannish roughing over the high notes It was laughing and urgent and ominous all at the same time and I knew at once that I was hearing Sara Tidwell who had never cut a record in her life I was hearing Sara Laughs and man she was rocking You know were going back to MANderley Were gonna dance on the SANderley Im gonna sing with the BANderley We gonna ball all we CANderley  Ball me baby yeah The basses  yes there were two  broke out in a barnyard shuffle like the break in Elviss version of Baby Lets Play House and then there was a guitar solo Son Tidwell playing that chickenscratch thing Lights gleamed in the dark and I thought of a song from the fifties  Claudine Clark singing Party Lights And here they were Japanese lanterns hung from the trees above the path of railroadtie steps leading from the house to the water Party lights casting mystic circles of radiance in the dark red blue and green Behind me Sara was singing the bridge to her Manderley song  mama likes it nasty mama likes it strong mama likes to party all night long  but it was fading Sara and the RedTop Boys had set up their bandstand in the driveway by the sound about where George Footman had parked when he came to serve me with Max Devores subpoena I was descending toward the lake through circles of radiance past party lights surrounded by softwinged moths One had found its way inside a lamp and it cast a monstrous batlike shadow against the ribbed paper The flowerboxes Jo had put beside the steps were full of nightblooming roses In the light of the Japanese lanterns they looked blue Now the band was only a faint murmur I could hear Sara shouting out the lyric laughing her way through it as though it were the funniest thing shed ever heard all that Manderleysanderleycanderley stuff but I could no longer make out the individual words Much clearer was the lap of the lake against the rocks at the foot of the steps the hollow clunk of the cannisters under the swimming float and the cry of a loon drifting out of the darkness Someone was standing on The Street to my right at the edge of the lake I couldnt see his face but I could see the brown sportcoat and the teeshirt he was wearing beneath it The lapels cut off some of the letters of the message so it looked like this ORMA ER OUN I knew what it said anyway  in dreams you almost always know dont you NORMAL SPERM COUNT a Village Cafe yuckitup special if ever there was one I was in the north bedroom dreaming all this and here I woke up enough to know I was dreaming    except it was like waking into another dream because Bunters bell was ringing madly and there was someone standing in the hall Mr Normal Sperm Count No not him The shadowshape falling on the door wasnt quite human It was slumped the arms indistinct I sat up into the silver shaking of the bell clutching a loose puddle of sheet against my naked waist sure it was the shroudthing out there  the shroudthing had come out of its grave to get me Please dont I said in a dry and trembling voice Please dont please The shadow on the door raised its arms It aint nuthin but a barndance sugar Sara Tidwells laughing furious voice sang It aint nuthin but a roundandround I lay back down and pulled the sheet over my face in a childish act of denial    and there I stood on our little lick of beach wearing just my undershorts My feet were ankledeep in the water It was warm the way the lake gets by midsummer My dim shadow was cast two ways in one direction by the scantling moon which rode low above the water in another by the Japanese lantern with the moth caught inside it The man whod been standing on the path was gone but he had left a plastic owl to mark his place It stared at me with frozen goldringed eyes Hey Irish I looked out at the swimming float Jo stood there She must have just climbed out of the water because she was still dripping and her hair was plastered against her cheeks She was wearing the twopiece swimsuit from the photo Id found gray with red piping Its been a long time Irish  what do you say Say about what I called back although I knew About this She put her hands over her breasts and squeezed Water ran out between her fingers and trickled across her knuckles Come on Irish she said from beside and above me come on you bastard lets go I felt her strip down the sheet pulling it easily out of my sleepnumbed fingers I shut my eyes but she took my hand and placed it between her legs As I found that velvety seam and began to stroke it open she began to rub the back of my neck with her fingers Youre not Jo I said Who are you But no one was there to answer I was in the woods It was dark and on the lake the loons were crying I was walking the path to Jos studio It wasnt a dream I could feel the cool air against my skin and the occasional bite of a rock into my bare sole or heel A mosquito buzzed around my ear and I waved it away I was wearing Jockey shorts and at every step they pulled against a huge and throbbing erection What the hell is this I asked as Jos little barnboard studio loomed in the dark I looked behind me and saw Sara on her hill not the woman but the house a long lodge jutting toward the nightbound lake Whats happening to me Everythings all right Mike Jo said She was standing on the float watching as I swam toward her She put her hands behind her neck like a calendar model lifting her breasts more fully into the damp halter As in the photo I could see her nipples poking out the cloth I was swimming in my underpants and with the same huge erection Everythings all right Mike Mattie said in the north bedroom and I opened my eyes She was sitting beside me on the bed smooth and naked in the weak glow of the nightlight Her hair was down hanging to her shoulders Her breasts were tiny the size of teacups but the nipples were large and distended Between her legs where my hand still lingered was a powderpuff of blonde hair smooth as down Her body was wrapped in shadows like mothwings like rosepetals There was something desperately attractive about her as she sat there  she was like the prize you know youll never win at the carny shooting gallery or the county fair ringtoss The one they keep on the top shelf She reached under the sheet and folded her fingers over the stretched material of my undershorts Everythings all right it aint nuthin but a roundandround said the UFO voice as I climbed the steps to my wifes studio I stooped fished for the key from beneath the mat and took it out I climbed the ladder to the float wet and dripping preceded by my engorged sex  is there anything I wonder so unintentionally comic as a sexually aroused man Jo stood on the boards in her wet bathing suit I pulled Mattie into bed with me I opened the door to Jos studio All of these things happened at the same time weaving in and out of each other like strands of some exotic rope or belt The thing with Jo felt the most like a dream the thing in the studio me crossing the floor and looking down at my old green IBM the least Mattie in the north bedroom was somewhere in between On the float Jo said Do what you want In the north bedroom Mattie said Do what you want In the studio no one had to tell me anything In there I knew exactly what I wanted On the float I bent my head and put my mouth on one of Jos breasts and sucked the clothcovered nipple into my mouth I tasted damp fabric and dank lake She reached for me where I stuck out and I slapped her hand away If she touched me I would come at once I sucked drinking back trickles of cottonwater groping with my own hands first caressing her ass and then yanking down the bottom half of her suit I got it off her and she dropped to her knees I did too finally getting rid of my wet clinging underpants and tossing them on top of her bikini panty We faced each other that way me naked her almost Who was the guy at the game I panted Who was he Jo No one in particular Irish Just another bag of bones She laughed then leaned back on her haunches and stared at me Her navel was a tiny black cup There was something queerly attractively snakelike in her posture Everything down there is death she said and pressed her cold palms and white pruney fingers to my cheeks She turned my head and then bent it so I was looking into the lake Under the water I saw decomposing bodies slipping by pulled by some deep current Their wet eyes stared Their fishnibbled noses gaped Their tongues lolled between white lips like tendrils of waterweed Some of the dead trailed pallid balloons of jellyfish guts some were little more than bone Yet not even the sight of this floating charnel parade could divert me from what I wanted I shrugged my head free of her hands pushed her down on the boards and finally cooled what was so hard and contentious sinking it deep Her moonsilvered eyes stared up at me through me and I saw that one pupil was larger than the other That was how her eyes had looked on the TV monitor when I had identified her in the Derry County Morgue She was dead My wife was dead and I was fucking her corpse Nor could even that realization stop me Who was he I cried at her covering her cold flesh as it lay on the wet boards Who was he Jo for Christs sake tell me who he was In the north bedroom I pulled Mattie on top of me relishing the feel of those small breasts against my chest and the length of her entwining legs Then I rolled her over on the far side of the bed I felt her hand reaching for me and slapped it away  if she touched me where she meant to touch me I would come in an instant Spread your legs hurry I said and she did I closed my eyes shutting out all other sensory input in favor of this I pressed forward then stopped I made one little adjustment pushing at my engorged penis with the side of my hand then rolled my hips and slipped into her like a finger in a silklined glove She looked up at me wideeyed then put a hand on my cheek and turned my head Everything out there is death she said as if only explaining the obvious In the window I saw Fifth Avenue between Fiftieth and Sixtieth  all those trendy shops Bijan and Bally Tiffany and Bergdorfs and Steuben Glass And here came Harold Oblowski northbound and swinging his pigskin briefcase the one Jo and I had given him for Christmas the year before she died Beside him carrying a Barnes and Noble bag by the handles was the bountiful beauteous Nola his secretary Except her bounty was gone This was a grinning yellowjawed skeleton in a Donna Karan suit and alligator pumps scrawny beringed bones instead of fingers gripped the baghandles Harolds teeth jutted in his usual agents grin now extended to the point of obscenity His favorite suit the doublebreasted charcoalgray from Paul Stuart flapped on him like a sail in a fresh breeze All around them on both sides of the street walked the living dead  mommy mummies leading baby corpses by the hands or wheeling them in expensive prams zombie doormen reanimated skateboarders Here a tall black man with a last few strips of flesh hanging from his face like cured deerhide walked his skeletal Alsatian The cabdrivers were rotting to raga music The faces looking down from the passing buses were skulls each wearing its own version of Harolds grin  Hey how are ya hows the wife hows the kids writing any good books lately The peanut vendors were putrefying Yet none of it could quench me I was on fire I slipped my hands under her buttocks lifting her biting at the sheet the pattern I saw with no surprise was blue roses until I pulled it free of the mattress to keep from biting her on the neck the shoulder the breasts anywhere my teeth could reach Tell me who he was I shouted at her You know I know you do My voice was so muffled by my mouthful of bedlinen that I doubted if anyone but me could have understood it Tell me you bitch On the path between Jos studio and the house I stood in the dark with the typewriter in my arms and that dreamspanning erection quivering below its metal bulk  all that ready and nothing willing Except maybe for the night breeze Then I became aware I was no longer alone The shroudthing was behind me called like the moths to the party lights It laugheda brazen smokebroken laugh that could belong to only one woman I didnt see the hand that reached around my hip to grip me  the typewriter was in the way  but I didnt need to see it to know its color was brown It squeezed slowly tightening the fingers wriggling What do you want to know sugar she asked from behind me Still laughing Still teasing Do you really want to know at all Do you want to know or do you want to feel Oh youre killing me I cried The typewriter  thirty or so pounds of IBM Selectric  was shaking back and forth in my arms I could feel my muscles twanging like guitar strings Do you want to know who he was sugar That nasty man Just do me you bitch I screamed She laughed again  that harsh laughter that was almost like a cough  and squeezed me where the squeezing was best You hold still now she said You hold still pretty boy less you want me to take fright and yank this thing of yours right out by the     I lost the rest as the whole world exploded in an orgasm so deep and strong that I thought it would simply tear me apart I snapped my head back like a man being hung and ejaculated looking up at the stars I screamed  I had to  and on the lake two loons screamed back At the same time I was on the float Jo was gone but I could faintly hear the sound of the band  Sara and Sonny and the RedTop Boys tearing through Black Mountain Rag I sat up dazed and spent fucked hollow I couldnt see the path leading up to the house but I could discern its switchback course by the Japanese lanterns My underpants lay beside me in a little wet heap I picked them up and started to put them on only because I didnt want to swim back to shore with them in my hand I stopped with them stretched between my knees looking at my fingers They were slimed with decaying flesh Puffing out from beneath several of the nails were clumps of tornout hair Corpsehair Oh Jesus I moaned The strength went out of me I flopped into wetness I was in the northwing bedroom What I had landed in was hot and at first I thought it was come The dim glow of the nightlight showed darker stuff however Mattie was gone and the bed was full of blood Lying in the middle of that soaking pool was something I at first glance took to be a clump of flesh or a piece of organ I looked more closely and saw it was a stuffed animal a blackfurred object matted red with blood I lay on my side looking at it wanting to bolt out of the bed and flee from the room but unable to do it My muscles were in a dead swoon Who had I really been having sex with in this bed And what had I done to her In Gods name what I dont believe these lies I heard myself say and as though it were an incantation I was slapped back together That isnt exactly what happened bur its the only way of saying that seems to come close to whatever did There were three of me  one on the float one in the north bedroom one on the path  and each one felt that hard slap as if the wind had grown a fist There was rushing blackness and in it the steady silver shaking of Bunters bell Then it faded and I faded with it For a little while I was nowhere at all I came back to the casual chatter of birds on summer vacation and to that peculiar red darkness that means the sun is shining through your closed eyelids My neck was stiff my head was canted at a weird angle my legs were folded awkwardly beneath me and I was hot I lifted my head with a wince knowing even as I opened my eyes that I was no longer in bed no longer on the swimming float no longer on the path between the house and the studio It was floorboards under me hard and uncompromising The light was dazzling I squinched my eyes closed again and groaned like a man with a hangover I eased them back open behind my cupped hands gave them time to adjust then cautiously uncovered them sat all the way up and looked around I was in the upstairs hall lying under the broken air conditioner Mrs Meserves note still hung from it Sitting outside my office door was the green IBM with a piece of paper rolled into it I looked down at my feet and saw that they were dirty Pine needles were stuck to my soles and one toe was scratched I got up staggered a little my right leg had gone to sleep then braced a hand against the wall and stood steady I looked down at myself I was wearing the Jockeys Id gone to bed in and I didnt look as if Id had an accident in them I pulled out the waistband and peeked inside My cock looked as it usually did small and soft curled up and asleep in its thatch of hair If Noonans Folly had been adventuring in the night there was no sign of it now It sure felt like an adventure I croaked I armed sweat off my forehead It was stifling up here Not the kind I ever read about in The Hardy Boys though Then I remembered the bloodsoaked sheet in the north bedroom and the stuffed animal lying on its side in the middle of it There was no sense of relief attached to the memory that thankGoditwasonlyadream feeling you get after a particularly nasty nightmare It felt as real as any of the things Id experienced in my measles feverdelirium    and all those things had been real just distorted by my overheated brain I staggered to the stairs and limped down them holding tight to the bannister in case my tingling leg should buckle At the foot I looked dazedly around the living room as if seeing it for the first time and then limped down the northwing corridor The bedroom door was ajar and for a moment I couldnt bring myself to push it all the way open and go in I was very badly scared and my mind kept trying to replay an old episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents the one about the man who strangles his wife during an alcoholic blackout He spends the whole half hour looking for her and finally finds her in the pantry bloated and openeyed Kyra Devore was the only kid of stuffedanimal age Id met recently but she had been sleeping peacefully under her cabbagerose coverlet when I left her mother and headed home It was stupid to think I had driven all the way back to Wasp Hill Road probably wearing nothing but my Jockeys that I had  What Raped the woman Brought the child here In my sleep I got the typewriter in my sleep didnt I Its sitting right upstairs in the goddam hallway Big difference between going thirty yards through the woods and five miles down the road to  I wasnt going to stand out here listening to those quarrelling voices in my head If I wasnt crazy  and I didnt think I was  listening to those contentious assholes would probably send me there and by the express I reached out and pushed the bedroom door open For a moment I actually saw a spreading octopuspattern of blood soaking into the sheet thats how real and focused my terror was Then I closed my eyes tight opened them and looked again The sheets were rumpled the bottom one mostly pulled free I could see the quilted satin hide of the mattress One pillow lay on the far edge of the bed The other was scrunched down at the foot The throw rug  a piece of Jos work  was askew and my waterglass lay overturned on the nighttable The bedroom looked as if it might have been the site of a brawl or an orgy but not a murder There was no blood and no little stuffed animal with black fur I dropped to my knees and looked under the bed Nothing there  not even dustkitties thanks to Brenda Meserve I looked at the groundsheet again first passing a hand over its rumpled topography then pulling it back down and resecuring the elasticized corners Great invention those sheets if women gave out the Medal of Freedom instead of a bunch of white politicians who never made a bed or washed a load of clothes in their lives the guy who thought up fitted sheets would undoubtedly have gotten a piece of that tin by now In a Rose Garden ceremony With the sheet pulled taut I looked again No blood not a single drop There was no stiffening patch of semen either The former I hadnt really expected or so I was already telling myself but what about the latter At the very least Id had the worlds most creative wetdream  a triptych in which I had screwed two women and gotten a handjob from a third all at the same time I thought I had that morningafter feeling too the one you get when the previous nights sex has been of the headbusting variety But if there had been fireworks where was the burnt gunpowder In Jos studio most likely I told the empty sunny room Or on the path between here and there Just be glad you didnt leave it in Mattie Devore bucko An affair with a postadolescent widow you dont need A part of me disagreed a part of me thought Mattie Devore was exactly what I did need But I hadnt had sex with her last night any more than I had had sex with my dead wife out on the swimming float or gotten a handjob from Sara Tidwell Now that I saw I hadnt killed a nice little kid either my thoughts turned back to the typewriter Why had I gotten it Why bother Oh man What a silly question My wife might have been keeping secrets from me maybe even having an affair there might be ghosts in the house there might be a rich old man half a mile south who wanted to put a sharp stick into me and then break it off there might be a few toys in my own humble attic for that matter But as I stood there in a bright shaft of sunlight looking at my shadow on the far wall only one thought seemed to matter I had gone out to my wifes studio and gotten my old typewriter and there was only one reason to do something like that I went into the bathroom wanting to get rid of the sweat on my body and the dirt on my feet before doing anything else I reached for the showerhandle then stopped The tub was full of water Either I had for some reason filled it during my sleepwalk    or something else had I reached for the drainlever then stopped again remembering that moment on the shoulder of Route  when my mouth had filled up with the taste of cold water I realized I was waiting for it to happen again When it didnt I opened the bathtub drain to let out the standing water and started the shower I could have brought the Selectric downstairs perhaps even lugged it out onto the deck where there was a little breeze coming over the surface of the lake but I didnt I had brought it all the way to the door of my office and my office was where Id work    if I could work Id work in there even if the temperature beneath the roofpeak built to a hundred and twenty degrees    which by three in the afternoon it just might The paper rolled into the machine was an old pinkcarbon receipt from Click the photo shop in Castle Rock where Jo had bought her supplies when we were down here Id put it in so that the blank side faced the Courier typeball On it I had typed the names of my little harem as if I had tried in some struggling way to report on my threefaceted dream even while it was going on Jo Sara Mattie Jo Sara Mattie Mattie Mattie Sara Sara Jo Johanna Sara Jo MattieSaraJo Below this in lower case normal sperm count sperm norm alls rosy I opened the office door carried the typewriter in and put it in its old place beneath the poster of Richard Nixon I pulled the pink slip out of the roller balled it up and tossed it into the wastebasket Then I picked up the Selectrics plug and stuck it in the baseboard socket My heart was beating hard and fast the way it had when I was thirteen and climbing the ladder to the high board at the Ypool I had climbed that ladder three times when I was twelve and then slunk back down it again once I turned thirteen there could be no chickening out  I really had to do it I thought Id seen a fan hiding in the far corner of the closet behind the box marked GADGETS I started in that direction then turned around again with a ragged little laugh Id had moments of confidence before hadnt I Yes And then the iron bands had clamped around my chest It would be stupid to get out the fan and then discover I had no business in this room after all Take it easy I said take it easy But I couldnt no more than that narrowchested boy in the ridiculous purple bathing suit had been able to take it easy when he walked to the end of the diving board the pool so green below him the upraised faces of the boys and girls in it so small so small I bent to one of the drawers on the right side of the desk and pulled so hard it came all the way out I got my bare foot out of its landing zone just in time and barked a gust of loud humorless laughter There was half a ream of paper in the drawer The edges had that faintly crispy look paper gets when its been sitting for a long time I no more than saw it before remembering I had brought my own supply  stuff a good deal fresher than this I left it where it was and put the drawer back in its hole It took several tries to get it on its tracks my hands were shaking At last I sat down in my desk chair hearing the same old creaks as it took my weight and the same old rumble of the casters as I rolled it forward snugging my legs into the kneehole Then I sat facing the keyboard sweating hard still remembering the high board at the Y how springy it had been under my bare feet as I walked its length remembering the echoing quality of the voices below me remembering the smell of chlorine and the steady low throb of the airexchangers fwungfwungfwungfwung as if the water had its own secret heartbeat I had stood at the end of the board wondering and not for the first time if you could be paralyzed if you hit the water wrong Probably not but you could die of fear There were documented cases of that in Ripleys Believe It or Not which served me as science between the ages of eight and fourteen Go on Jos voice cried My version of her voice was usually calm and collected this time it was shrill Stop dithering and go on I reached for the IBMs rockerswitch now remembering the day I had dropped my Word Six program into the Powerbooks trash Goodbye old pal I had thought Please let this work I said Please I lowered my hand and flicked the switch The machine came on The Courier ball did a preliminary twirl like a ballet dancer standing in the wings waiting to go on I picked up a piece of paper saw my sweaty fingers were leaving marks and didnt care I rolled it into the machine centered it then wrote Chapter One and waited for the storm to break The ringing of the phone or more accurately the way I received the ringing of the phone  was as familiar as the creaks of my chair or the hum of the old IBM Selectric It seemed to come from far away at first then to approach like a whistling train coming down on a crossing There was no extension in my office or Jos the upstairs phone an oldfashioned rotarydial was on a table in the hall between them  in what Jo used to call nomansland The temperature out there must have been at least ninety degrees but the air still felt cool on my skin after the office I was so oiled with sweat that I looked like a slightly potbellied version of the muscleboys I sometimes saw when I was working out Hello Mike Did I wake you Were you sleeping It was Mattie but a different one from last night This one wasnt afraid or even tentative this one sounded so happy she was almost bubbling over It was almost certainly the Mattie who had attracted Lance Devore Not sleeping I said Writing a little Get out I thought you were retired I thought so too I said but maybe I was a little hasty Whats going on You sound over the moon I just got off the phone with John Storrow   Really How long had I been on the second floor anyway I looked at my wrist and saw nothing but a pale circle It was halfpast freckles and skin oclock as we used to say when we were kids my watch was downstairs in the north bedroom probably lying in a puddle of water from my overturned nightglass   his age and that he can subpoena the other son Whoa I said You lost me Go back and slow down She did Telling the hard news didnt take long it rarely does Storrow was coming up tomorrow He would land at County Airport and stay at the Lookout Rock Hotel in Castle View The two of them would spend most of Friday discussing the case Oh and he found a lawyer for you she said To go with you to your deposition I think hes from Lewiston It all sounded good but what mattered a lot more than the bare facts was that Mattie had recovered her will to fight Until this morning if it was still morning the light coming in the window above the broken air conditioner suggested that if it was it wouldnt be much longer I hadnt realized how gloomy the young woman in the red sundress and tidy white sneakers had been How far down the road to believing she would lose her child This is great Im so glad Mattie And you did it If you were here Id give you the biggest kiss you ever had He told you you could win didnt he Yes And you believe him Yes Then her voice dropped a little He wasnt exactly thrilled when I told him Id had you over to dinner last night though No I said I didnt think he would be I told him we ate in the yard and he said we only had to be inside together for sixty seconds to start the gossip Id say hes got an insultingly low opinion of Yankee lovin I said but of course hes from New York She laughed harder than my little joke warranted I thought Out of semihysterical relief that she now had a couple of protectors Because the whole subject of sex was a tender one for her just now Best not to speculate He didnt paddle me too hard about it but he made it clear that he would if we did it again When this is over though Im having you for a real meal Well have everything you like just the way you like it Everything you like just the way you like it And she was by God and Sonny Jesus completely unaware that what she was saying might have another meaning  I would have bet on it I closed my eyes for a moment smiling Why not smile Everything she was saying sounded absolutely great especially once you cleared the confines of Michael Noonans dirty mind It sounded like we might have the expected fairytale ending if we could keep our courage and hold our course And if I could restrain myself from making a pass at a girl young enough to be my daughter    outside of my dreams that was If I couldnt I probably deserved whatever I got But Kyra wouldnt She was the hood ornament in all this doomed to go wherever the car took her If I got any of the wrong ideas Id do well to remember that If the judge sends Devore home emptyhanded Ill take you out to Renoir Nights in Portland and buy you nine courses of French chow I said Storrow too Ill even spring for the legal beagle Im dating on Friday So whos better than me huh No one I know she said sounding serious Ill pay you back for this Mike Im down now but I wont always be down If it takes me the rest of my life Ill pay you back Mattie you dont have to   I do she said with quiet vehemence I do And I have to do something else today too Whats that I loved hearing her sound the way she did this morning  so happy and free like a prisoner who has just been pardoned and let out of jail  but already I was looking longingly at the door to my office I couldnt do much more today Id end up baked like an apple if I tried but I wanted another page or two at least Do what you want both women had said in my dreams Do what you want I have to buy Kyra the big teddybear they have at the Castle Rock WalMart she said Ill tell her its for being a good girl because I cant tell her its for walking in the middle of the road when you were coming the other way Just not a black one I said The words were out of my mouth before I knew they were even in my head Huh Sounding startled and doubtful I said bring me back one I said the words once again out and down the wire before I even knew they were there Maybe I will she said sounding amused Then her tone grew serious again And if I said anything last night that made you unhappy even for a minute Im sorry I never for the world   Dont worry I said Im not unhappy A little confused thats all In fact Id pretty much forgotten about Jos mystery date A lie but in what seemed to me to be a good cause Thats probably for the best I wont keep you  go on back to work Its what you want to do isnt it I was startled What makes you say that I dont know I just     She stopped And I suddenly knew two things What she had been about to say and that she wouldnt say it I dreamed about you last night I dreamed about us together were going to make love and one of us said Do what you want Or maybe I dont know maybe we both said it Perhaps sometimes ghosts were alive  minds and desires divorced from their bodies unlocked impulses floating unseen Ghosts from the id spooks from low places Mattie Still there Sure you bet Do you want me to stay in touch Or will you hear all you need from John Storrow If you dont stay in touch Ill be pissed at you Royally She laughed I will then But not when youre working Goodbye Mike And thanks again So much I told her goodbye then stood there for a moment looking at the old fashioned Bakelite phone handset after she had hung up Shed call and keep me updated but not when I was working How would she know when that was She just would As Id known last night that she was lying when she said Jo and the man with the elbow patches on the sleeves of his sportcoat had walked off toward the parking lot Mattie had been wearing a pair of white shorts and a halter top when she called me no dress or skirt required today because it was Wednesday and the library was closed on Wednesday You dont know any of that Youre just making it up But I wasnt If Id been making it up I probably would have put her in something a little more suggestive  a Merry Widow from Victorias Secret perhaps That thought called up another Do what you want they had said Both of them Do what you want And that was a line I knew While on Key Largo Id read an Atlantic Monthly essay on pornography by some feminist I wasnt sure which one only that it hadnt been Naomi Wolf or Camille Paglia This woman had been of the conservative stripe and she had used that phrase Sally Tisdale maybe Or was my mind just hearing echodistortions of Sara Tidwell Whoever it had been shed claimed that do what I want was the basis of erotica which appealed to women and do what you want was the basis of pornography which appealed to men Women imagine speaking the former line in sexual situations men imagine having the latter line spoken to them And the writer went on when realworld sex goes bad  sometimes turning violent sometimes shaming sometimes just unsuccessful from the female partners point of view  porn is often the unindicted coconspirator The man is apt to round on the woman angrily and cry You wanted me to Quit lying and admit it You wanted me to The writer claimed it was what every man hoped to hear in the bedroom Do what you want Bite me sodomize me lick between my toes drink wine out of my navel give me a hairbrush and raise your ass for me to paddle it doesnt matter Do what you want The door is closed and we are here but really only you are here I am just a willing extension of your fantasies and only you are here I have no wants of my own no needs of my own no taboos Do what you want to this shadow this fantasy this ghost Id thought the essayist at least fifty per cent full of shit the assumption that a man can find real sexual pleasure only by turning a woman into a kind of jackoff accessory says more about the observer than the participants This lady had had a lot of jargon and a fair amount of wit but underneath she was only saying what Somerset Maugham Jos old favorite had had Sadie Thompson say in Rain a story written eighty years before men are pigs filthy dirty pigs all of them But we are not pigs as a rule not beasts or at least not unless we are pushed to the final extremity And if we are pushed to it the issue is rarely sex its usually territory Ive heard feminists argue that to men sex and territory are interchangeable and that is very far from the truth I padded back to the office opened the door and behind me the telephone rang again And here was another familiar sensation back for a return visit after four years that anger at the telephone the urge to simply rip it out of the wall and fire it across the room Why did the whole world have to call while I was writing Why couldnt they just    well  let me do what I wanted I gave a doubtful laugh and returned to the phone seeing the wet handprint on it from my last call Hello I said to stay visible while you were with her Good morning to you too Lawyer Storrow You must be in another timezone up there chum Ive got onefifteen down here in New York I had dinner with her I said Outside Its true that I read the little kid a story and helped put her to bed but   I imagine half the town thinks youre bopping each others brains out by now and the other half will think it if I have to show up for her in court But he didnt sound really angry I thought he sounded as though he was having a happyface day Can they make you tell whos paying for your services I asked At the custody hearing I mean Nope At my deposition on Friday Christ no Durgin would lose all credibility as guardian ad litem if he went in that direction Also they have reasons to steer clear of the sex angle Their focus is on Mattie as neglectful and perhaps abusive Proving that Mom isnt a nun quit working around the time Kramer vs Kramer came out in the movie theaters Nor is that the only problem they have with the issue He now sounded positively gleeful Tell me Max Devore is eightyfive and divorced Twice divorced in point of fact Before awarding custody to a single man of his age secondary custody has to be taken into consideration It is in fact the single most important issue other than the allegations of abuse and neglect levelled at the mother What are those allegations Do you know No Mattie doesnt either because theyre fabrications Shes a sweetie by the way   Yeah she is   and I think shes going to make a great witness I cant wait to meet her in person Meantime dont sidetrack me Were talking about secondary custody right Right Devore has a daughter who has been declared mentally incompetent and lives in an institution somewhere in California  Modesto I think Not a good bet for custody It wouldnt seem so The son Roger is     I heard a faint fluttering of notebook pages     fiftyfour So hes not exactly a spring chicken either Still there are lots of guys who become daddies at that age nowadays its a brave new world But Roger is a homosexual I thought of Bill Dean saying Rumpwrangler Understand theres a lot of that going around out them in California I thought you said sex doesnt matter Maybe I should have said hetero sex doesnt matter In certain states  California is one of them homo sex doesnt matter either    or not as much But this case isnt going to be adjudicated in California Its going to be adjudicated in Maine where folks are less enlightened about how well two married men  married to each other I mean  can raise a little girl Roger Devore is married Okay I admit it I now felt a certain horrified glee myself I was ashamed of it  Roger Devore was just a guy living his life and he might not have had much or anything to do with his elderly dads current enterprise  but I felt it just the same He and a software designer named Morris Ridding tied the knot in  John said I found that on the first computer sweep And if this does wind up in court I intend to make as much of it as I possibly can I dont know how much that will be  at this point its impossible to predict  but if I get a chance to paint a picture of that brighteyed cheerful little girl growing up with two elderly gays who probably spend most of their lives in computer chatrooms speculating about what Captain Kirk and Mr Spock might have done after the lights were out in officers country    well if I get that chance Ill take it It seems a little mean I said I heard myself speaking in the tone of a man who wants to be dissuaded perhaps even laughed at but that didnt happen Of course its mean It feels like swerving up onto the sidewalk to knock over a couple of innocent bystanders Roger Devore and Morris Ridding dont deal drugs traffic in little boys or rob old ladies But this is custody and custody does an even better job than divorce of turning human beings into insects This one isnt as bad as it could be but its bad enough because its so naked Max Devore came up there to his old hometown for one reason and one reason only to buy a kid That makes me mad I grinned imagining a lawyer who looked like Elmer Fudd standing outside of a rabbithole marked DEVORE with a shotgun My message to Devore is going to be very simple the price of the kid just went up Probably to a figure higher than even he can afford If it goes to court  youve said that a couple of times now Do you think theres a chance Devore might just drop it and go away A pretty good one yeah Id say an excellent one if he wasnt old and used to getting his own way Theres also the question of whether or not hes still sharp enough to know where his best interest lies Ill try for a meeting with him and his lawyer while Im up there but so far I havent managed to get past his secretary Rogette Whitmore No I think shes a step further up the ladder I havent talked to her yet either But I will Try either Richard Osgood or George Footman I said Either of them may be able to put you in touch with Devore or Devores chief counsel Ill want to talk to the Whitmore woman in any case Men like Devore tend to grow more and more dependent on their close advisors as they grow older and she could be a key to getting him to let this go She could also be a headache for us She might urge him to fight possibly because she really thinks he can win and possibly because she wants to watch the fur fly Also she might marry him Marry him Why not He could have her sign a prenup  I could no more introduce that in court than his lawyers could go fishing for who hired Matties lawyer  and it would strengthen his chances John Ive seen the woman Shes got to be seventy herself But shes a potential female player in a custody case involving a little girl and shes a layer between old man Devore and the married gay couple We just need to keep it in mind Okay I looked at the office door again but not so longingly There comes a point when youre done for the day whether you want to be or not and I thought I had reached that point Perhaps in the evening    The lawyer I got for you is named Romeo Bissonette He paused Can that be a real name Is he from Lewiston Yes how did you know Because in Maine especially around Lewiston that can be a real name Am I supposed to go see him I didnt want to go see him It was fifty miles to Lewiston over twolane roads which would now be crawling with campers and Winnebagos What I wanted was to go swimming and then take a long nap A long dreamless nap You dont need to Call him and talk to him a little Hes only a safety net really  hell object if the questioning leaves the incident on the morning of July Fourth About that incident you tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Got it Yes Talk to him before then meet him on Friday at    wait    its right here     The notebook pages fluttered again Meet him at the Route  Diner at ninefifteen Coffee Talk a little get to know each other maybe flip for the check Ill be with Mattie getting as much as I can We may want to hire a private dick I love it when you talk dirty Uhhuh Im going to see that bills go to your guy Goldacre Hell send them to your agent and your agent can   No I said Instruct Goldacre to send them directly here Harolds a Jewish mother How much is this going to cost me Seventyfive thousand dollars minimum he said with no hesitation at all With no apology in his voice either Dont tell Mattie All right Are you having any fun yet Mike You know I sort of am I said thoughtfully For seventyfive grand you should We said our goodbyes and John hung up As I put my own phone back into its cradle it occurred to me that I had lived more in the last five days than I had in the last four years This time the phone didnt ring and I made it all the way back into the office but I knew I was definitely done for the day I sat down at the IBM hit the RETURN key a couple of times and was beginning to write myself a nextnote at the bottom of the page Id been working on when the phone interrupted me What a sour little doodad the telephone is and what little good news we get from it Today had been an exception though and I thought I could sign off with a grin I was working after all  working Part of me still marvelled that I was sitting here at all breathing easily my heart beating steadily in my chest and not even a glimmer of an anxiety attack on my personal event horizon I wrote NEXT Drake to Raiford Stops on the way at vegetable stand to talk to the guy who runs it old source needs a good  colorful name Straw hat Disneyworld teeshirt They talk about Shackleford I turned the roller until the IBM spat this page out stuck it on top of the manuscript and jotted a final note to myself Call Ted Rosencrief about Raiford Rosencrief was a retired Navy man who lived in Derry I had employed him as a research assistant on several books using him on one project to find out how paper was made what the migratory habits of certain common birds were for another a little bit about the architecture of pyramid burial rooms for a third And its always a little bit I want never the whole damn thing As a writer my motto has always been dont confuse me with the facts The Arthur Hailey type of fiction is beyond me  I cant read it let alone write it I want to know just enough so I can lie colorfully Rosie knew that and we had always worked well together This time I needed to know a little bit about Floridas Raiford Prison and what the deathhouse down there is really like I also needed a little bit on the psychology of serial killers I thought Rosie would probably be glad to hear from me    almost as glad as I was to finally have something to call him about I picked up the eight doublespaced pages I had written and fanned through them still amazed at their existence Had an old IBM typewriter and a Courier typeball been the secret all along That was certainly how it seemed What had come out was also amazing Id had ideas during my fouryear sabbatical there had been no writers block in that regard One had been really great the sort of thing which certainly would have become a novel if Id still been able to write novels Half a dozen to a dozen were of the sort Id classify pretty good meaning theyd do in a pinch    or if they happened to unexpectedly grow tall and mysterious overnight like Jacks beanstalk Sometimes they do Most were glimmers little whatifs that came and went like shooting stars while I was driving or walking or just lying in bed at night and waiting to go to sleep The RedShirt Man was a whatif One day I saw a man in a bright red shirt washing the show windows of the JC Penney store in Derry  this was not long before Penneys moved out to the mall A young man and woman walked under his ladder    very bad luck according to the old superstition These two didnt know where they were walking though  they were holding hands drinking deeply of each others eyes as completely in love as any two twentyyearolds in the history of the world The man was tall and as I watched the top of his head came within an ace of clipping the windowwashers feet If that had happened the whole works might have gone over The entire incident was history in five seconds Writing The RedShirt Man took five months Except in truth the entire book was done in a whatif second I imagined a collision instead of a nearmiss Everything else followed from there The writing was just secretarial The idea I was currently working on wasnt one of Mikes Really Great Ideas Jos voice carefully made the capitals but it wasnt a whatif either Nor was it much like my old gothic suspense yarns V C Andrews with a prick was nowhere in sight this time But it felt solid like the real thing and this morning it had come out as naturally as a breath Andy Drake was a private investigator in Key Largo He was forty years old divorced the father of a threeyearold girl At the open he was in the Key West home of a woman named Regina Whiting Mrs Whiting also had a little girl hers five years old Mrs Whiting was married to an extremely rich developer who did not know what Andy Drake knew that until  Regina Taylor Whiting had been Tiffany Taylor a highpriced Miami callgirl That much I had written before the phone started ringing Here is what I knew beyond that point the secretarial work Id do over the next several weeks assuming that my marvellously recovered ability to work held up One day when Karen Whiting was three the phone had rung while she and her mother were sitting in the patio hot tub Regina thought of asking the yardguy to answer it then decided to get it herselftheir regular man was out with the flu and she didnt feel comfortable about asking a stranger for a favor Cautioning her daughter to sit still Regina hopped out to answer the phone When Karen put up a hand to keep from being splashed as her mother left the tub she dropped the doll she had been bathing When she bent to pick it up her hair became caught in one of the hot tubs powerful intakes It was reading of a fatal accident like this that had originally kicked the story off in my mind two or three years before The yardman some noname in a khaki shirt sent over by a daylabor outfit saw what was happening He raced across the lawn dove headfirst into the tub and yanked the child from the bottom leaving hair and a good chunk of scalp clogging the jet when he did Hed give her artificial respiration until she began to breathe again This would be a wonderful suspenseful scene and I couldnt wait to write it He would refuse all of the hysterical relieved mothers offers of recompense although hed finally give her an address so that her husband could talk to him Only both the address and his name John Sanborn would turn out to be a fake Two years later the exhooker with the respectable second life sees the man who saved her child on the front page of the Miami paper His name is given as John Shackleford and he has been arrested for the rapemurder of a nineyearold girl And the article goes on he is suspected in over forty other murders many of the victims children Have you caught Baseball Cap one of the reporters would yell at the press conference Is John Shackleford Baseball Cap Well I said going downstairs they sure think he is I could hear too many boats out on the lake this afternoon to make nude bathing an option I pulled on my suit slung a towel over my shoulders and started down the path  the one which had been lined with glowing paper lanterns in my dream  to wash off the sweat of my nightmares and my unexpected mornings labors There are twentythree railroadtie steps between Sara and the lake I had gone down only four or five before the enormity of what had just happened hit me My mouth began to tremble The colors of the trees and the sky mixed together as my eyes teared up A sound began to come out of me  a kind of muffled groaning The strength ran out of my legs and I sat down hard on a railroad tie For a moment I thought it was over mostly just a false alarm and then I began to cry I stuffed one end of the towel in my mouth during the worst of it afraid that if the boaters on the lake heard the sounds coming out of me theyd think someone up here was being murdered I cried in grief for the empty years I had spent without Jo without friends and without my work I cried in gratitude because those workless years seemed to be over It was too early to tell for sure  one swallow doesnt make a summer and eight pages of hard copy dont make a career resuscitation  but I thought it really might be so And I cried out of fear as well as we do when some awful experience is finally over or when some terrible accident has been narrowly averted I cried because I suddenly realized that I had been walking a white line ever since Jo died walking straight down the middle of the road By some miracle I had been carried out of harms way I had no idea who had done the carrying but that was all right  it was a question that could wait for another day I cried it all out of me Then I went on down to the lake and waded in The cool water felt more than good on my overheated body it felt like a resurrection State your name for the record Michael Noonan Your address Derry is my permanent address Benton Street but I also maintain a home in TR on Dark Score Lake The mailing address is Box  The actual house is on Lane Fortytwo off Route  Elmer Durgin Kyra Devores guardian ad litem waved a pudgy hand in front of his face either to shoo away some troublesome insect or to tell me that was enough I agreed that it was I felt rather like the little girl in Our Town who gave her address as Grovers Corner New Hampshire America the Northern Hemisphere the World the Solar System the Milky Way Galaxy the Mind of God Mostly I was nervous Id reached the age of forty still a virgin in the area of court proceedings and although we were in the conference room of Durgin Peters and Jarrette on Bridge Street in Castle Rock this was still a court proceeding There was one mentionably odd detail to these festivities The stenographer wasnt using one of those keyboardsonapost that look like adding machines but a Stenomask a gadget which fit over the lower half of his face I had seen them before but only in old blackandwhite crime movies the ones where Dan Duryea or John Payne is always driving around in a Buick with portholes on the sides looking grim and smoking a Camel Glancing over into the corner and seeing a guy who looked like the worlds oldest fighterpilot was weird enough but hearing everything you said immediately repeated in a muffled monotone was even weirder Thank you Mr Noonan My wife has read all your books and says you are her favorite author I just wanted to get that on the record Durgin chuckled fatly Why not He was a fat guy Most fat people I like  they have expansive natures to go with their expansive waistlines But there is a subgroup which I think of as the Evil Little Fat Folks You dont want to fuck with the ELFFS if you can help it they will burn your house and rape your dog if you give them half an excuse and a quarter of an opportunity Few of them stand over fivefoottwo Durgins height I estimated and many are under five feet They smile a lot but their eyes dont smile The Evil Little Fat Folks hate the whole world Mostly they hate folks who can look down the length of their bodies and still see their own feet This included me although just barely Please thank your wife for me Mr Durgin Im sure she could recommend one for you to start on Durgin chuckled On his right Durgins assistant  a pretty young woman who looked approximately seventeen minutes out of law school  chuckled On my left Romeo Bissonette chuckled In the corner the worlds oldest F  pilot only went on muttering into his Stenomask Ill wait for the bigscreen version he said His eyes gave an ugly little gleam as if he knew a feature film had never been made from one of my books  only a madeforTV movie of Being Two that pulled ratings roughly equal to the National Sofa Refinishing Championships I hoped that wed completed this chubby little fucks idea of the pleasantries I am Kyra Devores guardian ad litem he said Do you know what that means Mr Noonan I believe I do It means Durgin rolled on that Ive been appointed by Judge Rancourt to decide  if I can  where Kyra Devores best interests lie should a custody judgment become necessary Judge Rancourt would not in such an event be required to base his decision on my conclusions but in many cases that is what happens He looked at me with his hands folded on a blank legal pad The pretty assistant on the other hand was scribbling madly Perhaps she didnt trust the fighterpilot Durgin looked as if he expected a round of applause Was that a question Mr Durgin I asked and Romeo Bissonette delivered a light practiced chip to my ankle I didnt need to look at him to know it wasnt an accident Durgin pursed lips so smooth and damp that he looked as if he were wearing a clear gloss on them On his shining pate roughly two dozen strands of hair were combed in smooth little arcs He gave me a patient measuring look Behind it was all the intransigent ugliness of an Evil Little Fat Folk The pleasantries were over all right I was sure of it No Mr Noonan that was not a question I simply thought you might like to know why weve had to ask you to come away from your lovely lake on such a pleasant morning Perhaps I was wrong Now if   There was a peremptory knock on the door followed by your friend and his George Footman Today Cleveland Casual had been replaced by a khaki Deputy Sheriffs uniform complete with Sam Browne belt and sidearm He helped himself to a good look at the assistants bustline displayed in a blue silk blouse then handed her a folder and a cassette tape recorder He gave me one brief gander before leaving I remember you buddy that glance said The smartass writer the cheap date Romeo Bissonette tipped his head toward me He used the side of his hand to bridge the gap between his mouth and my ear Devores tape he said I nodded to show I understood then turned to Durgin again Mr Noonan youve met Kyra Devore and her mother Mary Devore havent you How did you get Mattie out of Mary I wondered    and then knew just as I had known about the white shorts and halter top Mattie was how Ki had first tried to say Mary Mr Noonan are we keeping you up Theres no need to be sarcastic is there Bissonette asked His tone was mild but Elmer Durgin gave him a look which suggested that should the ELFFS succeed in their goal of world domination Bissonette would be aboard the first gulagbound boxcar Im sorry I said before Durgin could reply I just got derailed there for a second or two New story idea Durgin asked smiling his glossy smile He looked like a swamptoad in a sportcoat He turned to the old jet pilot told him to strike that last then repeated his question about Kyra and Mattie Yes I said I had met them Once or more than once More than once How many times have you met them Twice Have you also spoken to Mary Devore on the phone Already these questions were moving in a direction that made me uncomfortable Yes How many times Three times The third had come the day before when she had asked if I would join her and John Storrow for a picnic lunch on the town common after my deposition Lunch right there in the middle of town before God and everybody    although with a New York lawyer to play chaperone what harm in that Have you spoken to Kyra Devore on the telephone What an odd question Not one anybody had prepared me for either I supposed that was at least partly why he had asked it Mr Noonan Yes Ive spoken to her once Can you tell us the nature of that conversation Well     I looked doubtfully at Bissonette but there was no help there He obviously didnt know either Mattie   Pardon me Durgin leaned forward as much as he could His eyes were intent in their pink pockets of flesh Mattie Mattie Devore Mary Devore You call her Mattie Yes I said and had a wild impulse to add In bed In bed I call her that Oh Mattie dont stop dont stop I cry Its the name she gave me when she introduced herself I met her   We may get to that but right now Im interested in your telephone conversation with Kyra Devore When was that It was yesterday July ninth  Yes Who placed that call Ma    Mary Devore Now hell ask why she called I thought and Ill say she wanted to have yet another sex marathon foreplay to consist of feeding each other chocolatedipped strawberries while we look at pictures of naked malformed dwarves How did Kyra Devore happen to speak to you She asked if she could I heard her saying to her mother that she had to tell me something What was it she had to tell you That she had her first bubble bath Did she also say she coughed I was quiet looking at him In that moment I understood why people hate lawyers especially when theyve been dusted over by one whos good at the job Mr Noonan would you like me to repeat the question No I said wondering where hed gotten his information Had these bastards tapped Matties phone My phone Both Perhaps for the first time I understood on a gut level what it must be like to have half a billion dollars With that much dough you could tap a lot of telephones She said her mother pushed bubbles in her face and she coughed But she was   Thank you Mr Noonan now lets turn to   Let him finish Bissonette said I had an idea he had already taken a bigger part in the proceedings than he had expected to but he didnt seem to mind He was a sleepylooking man with a bloodhounds mournful trustworthy face This isnt a courtroom and youre not crossexamining him I have the little girls welfare to think of Durgin said He sounded both pompous and humble at the same time a combination that went together like chocolate sauce on creamed corn Its a responsibility I take very seriously If I seemed to be badgering you Mr Noonan I apologize I didnt bother accepting his apology  that would have made us both phonies All I was going to say is that Ki was laughing when she said it She said she and her mother had a bubblefight When her mother came back on she was laughing too Durgin had opened the folder Footman had brought him and was paging rapidly through it while I spoke as if he werent hearing a word Her mother    Mattie as you call her Yes Mattie as I call her How do you know about our private telephone conversation in the first place Thats none of your business Mr Noonan He selected a single sheet of paper then closed the folder He held the paper up briefly like a doctor studying an Xray and I could see it was covered with singlespaced typing Lets turn to your initial meeting with Mary and Kyra Devore That was on the Fourth of July wasnt it Yes Durgin was nodding The morning of the Fourth And you met Kyra Devore first Yes You met her first because her mother wasnt with her at that time was she Thats a badly phrased question Mr Durgin but I guess the answer is yes Im flattered to have my grammar corrected by a man whos been on the bestseller lists Durgin said smiling The smile suggested that hed like to see me sitting next to Romeo Bissonette in that first gulagbound boxcar Tell us about your meeting first with Kyra Devore and then with Mary Devore Or Mattie if you like that better I told the story When I was finished Durgin centered the tape player in front of him The nails of his pudgy fingers looked as glossy as his lips Mr Noonan you could have run Kyra over isnt that true Absolutely not I was going thirtyfive  thats the speed limit there by the store I saw her in plenty of time to stop Suppose you had been coming the other way though  heading north instead of south Would you still have seen her in plenty of time That was a fairer question than some of his others actually Someone coming the other way would have had a far shorter time to react Still    Yes I said Durgin went up with the eyebrows Youre sure of that Yes Mr Durgin I might have had to come down a little harder on the brakes but   At thirtyfive Yes at thirtyfive I told you thats the speed limit     on that particular stretch of Route  Yes you told me that You did Is it your experience that most people obey the speed limit on that part of the road I havent spent much time on the TR since  so I cant   Come on Mr Noonan  this isnt a scene from one of your books Just answer my questions or well be here all morning Im doing my best Mr Durgin He sighed putupon Youve owned your place on Dark Score Lake since the eighties havent you And the speed limit around the Lakeview General Store the post office and Dick Brookss AllPurpose Garage  whats called The North Village  hasnt changed since then has it No I admitted Returning to my original question then  in your observation do most people on that stretch of road obey the thirtyfivemileanhour limit I cant say if its most because Ive never done a traffic survey but I guess a lot dont Would you like to hear Castle County Sheriffs Deputy Footman testify on where the greatest number of speeding tickets are given out in TR Mr Noonan No I said quite honestly Did other vehicles pass you while you were speaking first with Kyra Devore and then with Mary Devore Yes How many I dont know exactly A couple Could it have been three I guess Five No probably not so many But you dont know exactly do you Because Kyra Devore was upset Actually she had it together pretty well for a   Did she cry in your presence Well    yes Did her mother make her cry Thats unfair As unfair as allowing a threeyearold to go strolling down the middle of a busy highway on a holiday morning in your opinion or perhaps not quite as unfair as that Jeepers lay off Mr Bissonette said mildly There was distress on his bloodhounds face I withdraw the question Durgin said Which one I asked He looked at me tiredly as if to say he had to put up with assholes like me all the time and he was used to how we behaved How many cars went by from the time you picked the child up and carried her to safety to the time when you and the Devores parted company I hated that carried her to safety bit but even as I formulated my answer the old guy was muttering the question into his Stenomask And it was in fact what I had done There was no getting around it I told you I dont know for sure Well give me a guesstimate Guesstimate One of my alltime least favorite words A Paul Harvey word There might have been three Including Mary Devore herself Driving a   He consulted the paper hed taken from the folder   a  Jeep Scout I thought of Ki saying Mattie go fast and understood where Durgin was heading now And there was nothing I could do about it Yes it was her and it was a Scout I dont know what year Was she driving below the posted speed limit at the posted speed limit or above the posted speed limit when she passed the place where you were standing with Kyra in your arms Shed been doing at least fifty but I told Durgin I couldnt say for sure He urged me to try  I know you are unfamiliar with the hangmans knot Mr Noonan but Im sure you can make one if you really work at it  and I declined as politely as I could He picked up the paper again Mr Noonan would it surprise you to know that two witnesses  Richard Brooks Junior the owner of Dicks AllPurpose Garage and Royce Merrill a retired carpenter  claim that Mrs Devore was doing well over thirtyfive when she passed your location I dont know I said I was concerned with the little girl Would it surprise you to know that Royce Merrill estimated her speed at sixty miles an hour Thats ridiculous When she hit the brakes she would have skidded sideways and landed upside down in the ditch The skidmarks measured by Deputy Footman indicate a speed of at least fifty miles an hour Durgin said It wasnt a question but he looked at me almost roguishly as if inviting me to struggle a little more and sink a little deeper into this nasty pit I said nothing Durgin folded his pudgy little hands and leaned over them toward me The roguish look was gone Mr Noonan if you hadnt carried Kyra Devore to the side of the road  if you hadnt rescued her  mightnt her own mother have run her over Here was the really loaded question and how should I answer it Bissonette was certainly not flashing any helpful signals he seemed to be trying to make meaningful eyecontact with the pretty assistant I thought of the book Mattie was reading in tandem with Bartleby  Silent Witness by Richard North Patterson Unlike the Grisham brand Pattersons lawyers almost always seemed to know what they were doing Objection Your honor calls for speculation on the part of the witness I shrugged Sorry counsellor cant say  left my crystal ball home Again I saw the ugly flash in Durgins eyes Mr Noonan I can assure you that if you dont answer that question here you are apt to be called back from Malibu or Fire Island or wherever it is youre going to write your next opus to answer it later on I shrugged Ive already told you I was concerned with the child I cant tell you how fast the mother was going or how good Royce Merrills vision is or if Deputy Footman even measured the right set of skidmarks Theres a whole bunch of rubber on that part of the road I can tell you Suppose she was going fifty Even fiftyfive lets say that Shes twentyone years old Durgin At the age of twentyone a persons driving skills are at their peak She probably would have swerved around the child and easily I think thats quite enough Why Because youre not getting what you wanted Bissonettes shoe clipped my ankle again but I ignored it If youre on Kyras side why do you sound as though youre on her grandfathers A baleful little smile touched Durgins lips The kind that says Okay smart guy you want to play He pulled the taperecorder a little closer to him Since you have mentioned Kyras grandfather Mr Maxwell Devore of Palm Springs lets talk about him a little shall we Its your show Have you ever spoken with Maxwell Devore Yes In person or on the phone Phone I thought about adding that he had somehow gotten hold of my unlisted number then remembered that Mattie had too and decided to keep my mouth shut on that subject When was this Last Saturday night The night of the Fourth He called while I was watching the fireworks And was the subject of your conversation that mornings little adventure As he asked Durgin reached into his pocket and brought out a cassette tape There was an ostentatious quality to this gesture in that moment he looked like a parlor magician showing you both sides of a silk handkerchief And he was bluffing I couldnt be sure of that    and yet I was Devore had taped our conversation all right  that underhum really had been too loud and on some level Id been aware of that fact even while I was talking to him  and I thought it really was on the cassette Durgin was now slotting into the cassette player    but it was a bluff I dont recall I said Durgins hand froze in the act of snapping the cassettes transparent loading panel shut He looked at me with frank disbelief    and something else I thought the something else was surprised anger You dont recall Come now Mr Noonan Surely writers train themselves to recall conversations and this one was only a week ago Tell me what you talked about I really cant say I told him in a stolid colorless voice For a moment Durgin looked almost panicky Then his features smoothed One polished fingernail slipped back and forth over keys marked REW FF PLAY and REC How did Mr Devore begin the conversation he asked He said hello I said mildly and there was a short muffled sound from behind the Stenomask It could have been the old guy clearing his throat it could have been a suppressed laugh Spots of color were blooming in Durgins cheeks After hello What then I dont recall Did he ask you about that morning I dont recall Didnt you tell him that Mary Devore and her daughter were together Mr Noonan That they were together picking flowers Isnt that what you told this worried grandfather when he inquired about the incident which was the talk of the township that Fourth of July Oh boy Bissonette said He raised one hand over the table then touched the palm with the fingers of the other making a refs T Time out Durgin looked at him The flush in his cheeks was more pronounced now and his lips had pulled back enough to show the tips of small neatly capped teeth What do you want he almost snarled as if Bissonette had just dropped by to tell him about the Mormon Way or perhaps the Rosicrucians I want you to stop leading this guy and I want that whole thing about picking flowers stricken from the record Bissonette said Why Durgin snapped Because youre trying to get stuff on the record that this witness wont say If you want to break here for awhile so we can make a conference call to Judge Rancourt get his opinion   I withdraw the question Durgin said He looked at me with a kind of helpless surly rage Mr Noonan do you want to help me do my job I want to help Kyra Devore if I can I said Very well He nodded as if no distinction had been made Then please tell me what you and Maxwell Devore talked about I cant recall I caught his eyes and held them Perhaps I said you can refresh my recollection There was a moment of silence like that which sometimes strikes a highstakes poker game just after the last of the bets have been made and just before the players show their hands Even the old fighterpilot was quiet his eyes unblinking above the mask Then Durgin pushed the cassette player aside with the heel of his hand the set of his mouth said he felt about it just then as I often felt about the telephone and went back to the morning of July Fourth He never asked about my dinner with Mattie and Ki on Tuesday night and never returned to my telephone conversation with Devore  the one where I had said all those awkward and easily disprovable things I went on answering questions until eleventhirty but the interview really ended when Durgin pushed the tapeplayer away with the heel of his hand I knew it and Im pretty sure he did too Mike Mike over here Mattie was waving from one of the tables in the picnic area behind the town commons bandstand She looked vibrant and happy I waved back and made my way in that direction weaving between little kids playing tag skirting a couple of teenagers making out on the grass and ducking a Frisbee which a leaping German shepherd caught smartly There was a tall skinny redhead with her but I barely got a chance to notice him Mattie met me while I was still on the gravel path put her arms around me hugged me  it was no prudey little asspokingout hug either  and then kissed me on the mouth hard enough to push my lips against my teeth There was a hearty smack when she disengaged She pulled back and looked at me with undisguised delight Was it the biggest kiss youve ever had The biggest in at least four years I said Will you settle for that And if she didnt step away from me in the next few seconds she was going to have physical proof of how much I had enjoyed it I guess Ill have to She turned to the redheaded guy with a funny kind of defiance Was that all right Probably not he said but at least youre not currently in view of those old boys at the AllPurpose Garage Mike Im John Storrow Nice to meet you in person I liked him at once maybe because Id come upon him dressed in his threepiece New York suit and primly setting out paper plates on a picnic table while his curly red hair blew around his head like kelp His skin was fair and freckled the kind which would never tan only burn and then peel in great eczemalike patches When we shook his hand seemed to be all knuckles He had to be at least thirty but he looked Matties age and I guessed it would be another five years before he was able to get a drink without showing his drivers license Sit down he said Weve got a fivecourse lunch courtesy of Castle Rock Variety  grinders which are for some strange reason called Italian sandwiches up here    mozzarella sticks    garlic fries    Twinkies Thats only four I said I forgot the softdrink course he said and pulled three longneck bottles of SOK birch beer out of a brown bag Lets eat Mattie runs the library from two to eight on Fridays and Saturdays and this would be a bad time for her to be missing work How did the readers circle go last night I asked Lindy Briggs didnt eat you alive I see She laughed clasped her hands and shook them over her head I was a hit An absolute smashola I didnt dare tell them I got all my best insights from you   Thank God for small favors Storrow said He was freeing his own sandwich from its string and butcherpaper wrapping doing it carefully and a little dubiously using just the tips of his fingers   so I said I looked in a couple of books and found some leads there It was sort of wonderful I felt like a college kid Good Bissonette John Storrow asked Wheres he I never met a guy named Romeo before Said he had to go right back to Lewiston Sorry Actually its best we stay small at least to begin with He bit into his sandwich  they come tucked into long sub rolls  and looked at me surprised This isnt bad Eat more than three and youre hooked for life Mattie said and chomped heartily into her own Tell us about the depo John said and while they ate I talked When I finished I picked up my own sandwich and played a little catchup Id forgotten how good an Italian can be  sweet sour and oily all at the same time Of course nothing that tastes that good can be healthy thats a given I suppose one could formulate a similar postulate about fullbody hugs from young girls in legal trouble Very interesting John said Very interesting indeed He took a mozzarella stick from its greasestained bag broke it open and looked with a kind of fascinated horror at the clotted white gunk inside People up here eat this he asked People in New York eat fishbladders I said Raw Touch He dipped a piece into the plastic container of spaghetti sauce in this context it is called cheesedip in western Maine then ate it Well I asked Not bad They ought to be a lot hotter though Yes he was right about that Eating cold mozzarella sticks is a little like eating cold snot an observation I thought I would keep to myself on this beautiful midsummer Friday If Durgin had the tape why wouldnt he play it Mattie asked I dont understand John stretched his arms out cracked his knuckles and looked at her benignly Well probably never know for sure he said He thought Devore was going to drop the suit  it was in every line of his bodylanguage and every inflection of his voice That was hopeful but it would be good if Mattie didnt allow herself to become too hopeful John Storrow wasnt as young as he looked and probably not as guileless either or so I fervently hoped but he was young And neither he nor Mattie knew the story of Scooter Larribees sled Or had seen Bill Deans face when he told it Want to hear some possibilities Sure I said John put down his sandwich wiped his fingers and then began to tick off points First he made the call Taped conversations have a highly dubious value under those circumstances Second he didnt exactly come off like Captain Kangaroo did he No Third your fabrication impugns you Mike but not really very much and it doesnt impugn Mattie at all And by the way that thing about Mattie pushing bubbles in Kyras face I love that If thats the best they can do they better give it up right now Last  and this is where the truth probably lies  I think Devores got Nixons Disease Nixons Disease Mattie asked The tape Durgin had isnt the only tape Cant be And your fatherinlaw is afraid that if he introduces one tape made by whatever system hes got in Warringtons we might subpoena all of them And Id damn well try She looked bewildered What could be on them And if its bad why not just destroy them Maybe he cant I said Maybe he needs them for other reasons It doesnt really matter John said Durgin was bluffing and thats what matters He hit the heel of his hand lightly against the picnic table I think hes going to drop it I really do Its too early to start thinking like that I said at once but I could tell by Matties face  shining more brightly than ever  that the damage was done Fill him in on what else youve been doing Mattie told John Then Ive got to get to the library Where do you send Kyra on your workdays I asked Mrs Cullums She lives two miles up the Wasp Hill Road Also in July theres VBS from ten until three Thats Vacation Bible School Ki loves it especially the singing and the flannelboard stories about Noah and Moses The bus drops her off at Arlenes and I pick her up around quarter of nine She smiled a little wistfully By then shes usually fast asleep on the couch John held forth for the next ten minutes or so He hadnt been on the case long but had already started a lot of balls rolling A fellow in California was gathering facts about Roger Devore and Morris Ridding gathering facts sounded so much better than snooping John was particularly interested in learning about the quality of Roger Devores relations with his father and if Roger was on record concerning his little niece from Maine John had also mapped out a campaign to learn as much as possible about Max Devores movements and activities since hed come back to TR To that end he had the name of a private investigator one recommended by Romeo Bissonette my rentalawyer As he spoke paging rapidly through a little notebook he drew from the inside pocket of his suitcoat I remembered what hed said about Lady Justice during our telephone conversation Slap some handcuffs on that broads wrists and some tape over her mouth to go along with the blindfold rape her and roll her in the mud That was maybe a bit too strong for what we were doing but I thought at the very least we were shoving her around a little I imagined poor Roger Devore up on the stand having flown three thousand miles in order to be questioned about his sexual preferences I had to keep reminding myself that his father had put him in that position not Mattie or me or John Storrow Have you gotten any closer to a meeting with Devore and his chief legal advisor I asked Dont know for sure The line is in the water the offer is on the table the pucks on the ice pick your favorite metaphor mix em and match em if you desire Got your irons in the fire Mattie said Your checkers on the board I added We looked at each other and laughed John regarded us sadly then sighed picked up his sandwich and began to eat again You really have to meet him with his lawyer more or less dancing attendance I asked Would you like to win this thing then discover Devore can do it all again based on unethical behavior by Mary Devores legal resource John returned Dont even joke about it Mattie cried I wasnt joking John said It has to be with his lawyer yes I dont think its going to happen not on this trip I havent even got a look at the old cockuh and I have to tell you my curiosity is killing me If thats all it takes to make you happy show up behind the backstop at the softball field next Tuesday evening Mattie said Hell be there in his fancy wheelchair laughing and clapping and sucking his damned old oxygen every fifteen minutes or so Not a bad idea John said I have to go back to New York for the weekend  Im leaving aprs Osgood  but maybe Ill show up on Tuesday I might even bring my glove He began clearing up our litter and once again I thought he looked both prissy and endearing at the same time like Stan Laurel wearing an apron Mattie eased him aside and took over No one ate any Twinkles she said a little sadly Take them home to your daughter John said No way I dont let her eat stuff like this What kind of mother do you think I am She saw our expressions replayed what shed just said then burst out laughing We joined her Matties old Scout was parked in one of the slant spaces behind the war memorial which in Castle Rock is a World War I soldier with a generous helping of birdshit on his piedish helmet A brandnew Taurus with a Hertz decal above the inspection sticker was parked next to it John tossed his briefcase  reassuringly thin and not very ostentatious  into the back seat If I can make it back on Tuesday Ill call you he told Mattie If Im able to get an appointment with your fatherinlaw through this man Osgood I will also call you Ill buy the Italian sandwiches Mattie said He smiled then grasped her arm in one hand and mine in the other He looked like a newly ordained minister getting ready to marry his first couple You two talk on the telephone if you need to he said always remembering that one or both lines may be tapped Meet in the market if you happen to Mike you might feel a need to drop by the local library and check out a book Not until you renew your card though Mattie said giving me a demure glance But no more visits to Matties trailer Is that understood I said yes she said yes John Storrow looked unconvinced It made me wonder if he was seeing something in our faces or bodies that shouldnt be there They are committed to a line of attack which probably isnt going to work he said We cant risk giving them the chance to change course That means innuendos about the two of you it also means innuendos about Mike and Kyra Matties shocked expression made her look twelve again Mike and Kyra What are you talking about Allegations of child molestation thrown up by people so desperate theyll try anything Thats ridiculous she said And if my fatherinlaw wanted to sling that kind of mud   John nodded Yes wed be obligated to sling it right back Newspaper coverage from coast to coast would follow maybe even Court TV God bless and save us We want none of that if we can avoid it Its not good for the grownups and its not good for the child Now or later He bent and kissed Matties cheek Im sorry about all this he said and he did sound genuinely sorry Custodys just this way I think you warned me Its just that    the idea someone might make a thing like that up just because there was no other way for them to win     Let me warn you again he said His face came as close to grim as its young and goodnatured features would probably allow What we have is a very rich man with a very shaky case The combination could be like working with old dynamite I turned to Mattie Are you still worried about Ki Still feel shes in danger I saw her think about hedging her response  out of plain old Yankee reserve quite likely  and then deciding not to Deciding perhaps that hedging was a luxury she couldnt afford Yes But its just a feeling you know John was frowning I supposed the idea that Devore might resort to extralegal means of obtaining what he wanted had occurred to him as well Keep your eye on her as much as you can he said I respect intuition Is yours based on anything concrete No Mattie answered and her quick glance in my direction asked me to keep my mouth shut Not really She opened the Scouts door and tossed in the little brown bag with the Twinkies in it  she had decided to keep them after all Then she turned to John and me with an expression that was close to anger Im not sure how to follow that advice anyway I work five days a week and in August when we do the microfiche update itll be six Right now Ki gets her lunch at Vacation Bible School and her dinner from Arlene Cullum I see her in the mornings The rest of the time     I knew what she was going to say before she said it the expression was an old one     shes on the TR I could help you find an au pair I said thinking it would be a hell of a lot cheaper than John Storrow No they said in such perfect unison that they glanced at each other and laughed But even while she was laughing Mattie looked tense and unhappy Were not going to leave a paper trail for Durgin or Devores custody team to exploit John said Who pays me is one thing Who pays Matties childcare help is another Besides Ive taken enough from you Mattie said More than I can sleep easy on Im not going to get in any deeper just because Ive been having megrims She climbed into the Scout and closed the door I rested my hands on her open window Now we were on the same level and the eyecontact was so strong it was disconcerting Mattie I dont have anything else to spend it on Really When it comes to Johns fee I accept that Because Johns fee is about Ki She put her hand over mine and squeezed briefly This other is about me All right Yeah But you need to tell your babysitter and the people who run this Bible thing that youve got a custody case on your hands a potentially bitter one and Kyras not to go anywhere with anyone even someone they know without your sayso She smiled Its already been done On Johns advice Stay in touch Mike She lifted my hand gave it a hearty smack and drove away What do you think I asked John as we watched the Scout blow oil on its way to the new Prouty Bridge which spans Castle Street and spills outbound traffic onto Highway  I think its grand she has a wellheeled benefactor and a smart lawyer John said He paused then added But Ill tell you something  she somehow doesnt feel lucky to me at all Theres a feeling I get    I dont know     That theres a cloud around her you cant quite see Maybe Maybe thats it He raked his hands through the restless mass of his red hair I just know its something sad I knew exactly what he meant    except for me there was more I wanted to be in bed with her sad or not right or not I wanted to feel her hands on me tugging and pressing patting and stroking I wanted to be able to smell her skin and taste her hair I wanted to have her lips against my ear her breath tickling the fine hairs within its cup as she told me to do what I wanted whatever I wanted I got back to Sara Laughs shortly before two oclock and let myself in thinking about nothing but my study and the IBM with the Courier ball I was writing again  writing I could still hardly believe it Id work not that it felt much like work after a fouryear layoff until maybe six oclock swim then go down to the Village Cafe for one of Buddys cholesterolrich specialties The moment I stepped through the door Bunters bell began to ring stridently I stopped in the foyer my hand frozen on the knob The house was hot and bright not a shadow anywhere but the gooseflesh forming on my arms felt like midnight Whos here I called The bell stopped ringing There was a moment of silence and then a woman shrieked It came from everywhere pouring out of the sunny moteladen air like sweat out of hot skin It was a scream of outrage anger grief    but mostly I think of horror And I screamed in response I couldnt help it I had been frightened standing in the dark cellar stairwell listening to the unseen fist thump on the insulation but this was far worse It never stopped that scream It faded as the childs sobs had faded faded as if the person screaming was being carried rapidly down a long corridor and away from me At last it was gone I leaned against the bookcase my palm pressed against my teeshirt my heart galloping beneath it I was gasping for breath and my muscles had that queer exploded feel they get after youve had a bad scare A minute passed My heartbeat gradually slowed and my breathing slowed with it I straightened up took a tottery step and when my legs held me took two more I stood in the kitchen doorway looking across to the living room Above the fireplace Bunter the moose looked glassily back at me The bell around his neck hung still and chimeless A hot sunpoint glowed on its side The only sound was that stupid Felix the Cat clock in the kitchen The thought nagging at me even then was that the screaming woman had been Jo that Sara Laughs was being haunted by my wife and that she was in pain Dead or not she was in pain Jo I asked quietly Jo are you   The sobbing began again  the sound of a terrified child At the same moment my mouth and nose once more filled with the iron taste of the lake I put one hand to my throat gagging and frightened then leaned over the sink and spat It was as it had been before  instead of voiding a gush of water nothing came out but a little spit The waterlogged feeling was gone as if it had never been there I stayed where I was grasping the counter and bent over the sink probably looking like a drunk who has finished the party by upchucking most of the nights bottled cheer I felt like that too  stunned and bleary too overloaded to really understand what was going on At last I straightened up again took the towel folded over the dishwashers handle and wiped my face with it There was tea in the fridge and I wanted a tall icechoked glass of it in the worst way I reached for the doorhandle and froze The fruit and vegetable magnets were drawn into a circle again In the center was this help im drown Thats it I thought Im getting out of here Right now Today Yet an hour later I was up in my stifling study with a glass of tea on the desk beside me the cubes in it long since melted dressed only in my bathing trunks and lost in the world I was making  the one where a private detective named Andy Drake was trying to prove that John Shackleford was not the serial killer nicknamed Baseball Cap This is how we go on one day at a time one meal at a time one pain at a time one breath at a time Dentists go on one rootcanal at a time boatbuilders go on one hull at a time If you write books you go on one page at a time We turn from all we know and all we fear We study catalogues watch football games choose Sprint over ATT We count the birds in the sky and will not turn from the window when we hear the footsteps behind us as something comes up the hall we say yes I agree that clouds often look like other things  fish and unicorns and men on horseback  but they are really only clouds Even when the lightning flashes inside them we say they are only clouds and turn our attention to the next meal the next pain the next breath the next page This is how we go on The book was big okay The book was major I was afraid to change rooms let alone pack up the typewriter and my slim justbegun manuscript and take it back to Derry That would be as dangerous as taking an infant out in a windstorm So I stayed always reserving the right to move out if things got too weird the way smokers reserve the right to quit if their coughs get too heavy and a week passed Things happened during that week but until I met Max Devore on The Street the following Friday the seventeenth of July it would have been  the most important thing was that I continued to work on a novel which would if finished be called My Childhood Friend Perhaps we always think what was lost was the best    or would have been the best I dont know for sure What I do know is that my real life that week had mostly to do with Andy Drake John Shackleford and a shadowy figure standing in the deep background Raymond Garraty John Shacklefords childhood friend A man who sometimes wore a baseball cap During that week the manifestations in the house continued but at a lower level  there was nothing like that bloodcurdling scream Sometimes Bunters bell rang and sometimes the fruit and vegetable magnets would reform themselves into a circle    never with words in the middle though not that week One morning I got up and the sugar cannister was overturned making me think of Matties story about the flour Nothing was written in the spill but there was a squiggle   as though something had tried to write and failed If so I sympathized I knew what that was like My depo before the redoubtable Elmer Durgin was on Friday the tenth On the following Tuesday I took The Street down to Warringtons softball field hoping for my own peek at Max Devore It was going on six oclock when I got within hearing range of the shouts cheers and batted balls A path marked with rustic signs curlicued Ws burned into oak arrows led past an abandoned boathouse a couple of sheds and a gazebo halfburied in blackberry creepers I eventually came out in deep center field A litter of potatochip bags candywrappers and beer cans suggested that others sometimes watched the games from this vantagepoint I couldnt help thinking about Jo and her mysterious friend the guy in the old brown sportcoat the burly guy who had slipped an arm around her waist and led her away from the game laughing back toward The Street Twice over the weekend Id come close to calling Bonnie Amudson seeing if maybe I could chase that guy down put a name on him and both times I had backed off Sleeping dogs I told myself each time Sleeping dogs Michael I had the area beyond deep center to myself that evening and it felt like the right distance from home plate considering the man who usually parked his wheelchair behind the backstop had called me a liar and I had invited him to store my telephone number where the sunshine grows dim I neednt have worried in any case Devore wasnt in attendance nor was the lovely Rogette I did spot Mattie behind the casually maintained chickenwire barrier on the firstbase line John Storrow was beside her wearing jeans and a polo shirt his red hair mostly corralled by a Mets cap They stood watching the game and chatting like old friends for two innings before they saw me  more than enough time for me to feel envious of Johns position and a little jealous as well Finally someone lofted a long fly to center where the edge of the woods served as the only fence The center fielder backed up but it was going to be far over his head It was hit to my depth off to my right I moved in that direction without thinking highfooting through the shrubs that formed a zone between the mown outfield and the trees hoping I wasnt running through poison ivy I caught the softball in my outstretched left hand and laughed when some of the spectators cheered The center fielder applauded me by tapping his bare right hand into the pocket of his glove The batter meanwhile circled the bases serenely knowing he had hit a groundrule home run I tossed the ball to the fielder and as I returned to my original post among the candywrappers and beer cans I looked back in and saw Mattie and John looking at me If anything confirms the idea that were just another species of animal one with a slightly bigger brain and a much bigger idea of our own importance in the scheme of things its how much we can convey by gesture when we absolutely have to Mattie clasped her hands to her chest tilted her head to the left raised her eyebrows  My hero I held my hands to my shoulders and flipped the palms skyward Shucks maam twarnt nothin John lowered his head and put his fingers to his brow as if something there hurt  You lucky sonofabitch With those comments out of the way I pointed at the backstop and shrugged a question Both Mattie and John shrugged back An inning later a little boy who looked like one giant exploding freckle ran out to where I was his oversized Michael Jordan jersey churning around his shins like a dress Guy down there gimme fifty cent to say you should call im later on at his hotel over in the Rock he said pointing at John He say you gimme another fifty cent if there was an answer Tell him Ill call him around ninethirty I said I dont have any change though Can you take a buck Hey yeah swank He snatched it turned away then turned back He grinned revealing a set of teeth caught between Act I and Act II With the softball players in the background he looked like a Norman Rockwell archetype Guy also say tell you that was a bullshit catch Tell him people used to say the same thing about Willie Mays all the time Willie who Ah youth Ah mores Just tell him son Hell know I stayed another inning but by then the game was getting drunk Devore still hadnt shown and I went back home the way I had come I met one fisherman standing out on a rock and two young people strolling along The Street toward Warringtons their hands linked They said hi and I hid them back I felt lonely and content at the same time I believe that is a rare kind of happiness Some people check their phone answering machines when they get home that summer I always checked the front of the fridge Eeniemeeniechilibeanie as Bullwinkle Moose used to say the spirits are about to speak That night they hadnt although the fruit and vegetable magnets had reformed into a sinuous shape like a snake or perhaps the letter S taking a nap A little later I called John and asked him where Devore had been and he repeated in words what he had already told me and much more economically by gesture Its the first game hes missed since he came back he said Mattie tried asking a few people if he was okay and the consensus seemed to be that he was    at least as far as anyone knew What do you mean she tried asking a few people I mean that several wouldnt even talk to her Cut her dead my parents generation would have said Watch it buddy I thought but didnt say thats only half a step from my generation One of her old girlfriends spoke to her finally but theres a general attitude about Mattie Devore That man Osgood may be a shitty salesman but as Devores Mr Moneyguy hes doing a wonderful job of separating Mattie from the other folks in the town Is it a town Mike I dont quite get that part Its just the TR I said absently Theres no real way to explain it Do you actually believe Devores bribing everyone That doesnt say much for the old Wordsworthian idea of pastoral innocence and goodness does it Hes spreading money and using Osgood  maybe Footman too  to spread stories And the folks around here seem at least as honest as honest politicians The ones who stay bought Yeah Oh and I saw one of Devores potential star witnesses in the Case of the Runaway Child Royce Merrill He was over by the equipment shed with some of his cronies Did you happen to notice him I said I had not Guy must be a hundred and thirty John said Hes got a cane with a gold head the size of an elephants asshole Thats a Boston Post cane The oldest person in the area gets to keep it And I have no doubt he came by it honestly If Devores lawyers put him on the stand Ill debone him There was something chilling in Johns gleeful confidence Im sure I said How did Mattie take getting cut dead by her old friends I was thinking of her saying that she hated Tuesday nights hated to think of the softball games going on as they always had at the field where she had met her late husband She did okay John said I think shes given most of them up as a lost cause anyway I had my doubts about that  I seem to remember that at twentyone lost causes are sort of a specialty  but I didnt say anything Shes hanging in Shes been lonely and scared I think that in her own mind she might already have begun the process of giving Kyra up but shes got her confidence back now Mostly thanks to meeting you Talk about your fantastically lucky breaks Well maybe I flashed on Jos brother Frank once saying to me that he didnt think there was any such thing as luck only fate and inspired choices And then I remembered that image of the TR crisscrossed with invisible cables connections that were unseen but as strong as steel John I forgot to ask the most important question of all the other day after I gave my depo This custody case were all so concerned about    has it even been scheduled Good question Ive checked three ways to Sunday and Bissonette has too Unless Devore and his people have pulled something really slippery like filing in another court district I dont think it has been Could they do that File in another district Maybe But probably not without us finding out So what does it mean That Devores on the verge of giving up John said promptly As of now I see no other way of explaining it Im going back to New York first thing tomorrow but Ill stay in touch If anything comes up here you do the same I said I would and went to bed No female visitors came to share my dreams That was sort of a relief When I came downstairs to recharge my icedtea glass late Wednesday morning Brenda Meserve had erected the laundry whirligig on the back stoop and was hanging out my clothes This she did as her mother had no doubt taught her with pants and shirts on the outside and undies on the inside where any passing nosyparkers couldnt see what you chose to wear closest to your skin You can take these in around four oclock Mrs M said as she prepared to leave She looked at me with the bright and cynical eye of a woman who has been doing for welloff men her entire life Dont you forget and leave em out all night  dewy clothes dont ever feel fresh until theyre warshed again I told her most humbly that I would remember to take in my clothes I then asked her  feeling like a spy working an embassy party for information  if the house felt all right to her All right how she asked cocking one wild eyebrow at me Well Ive heard funny noises a couple of times In the night She sniffed Its a log house ennit Built in relays so to speak It settles one wing against tother Thats what you hear most likely No ghosts huh I said as if disappointed Not that Ive ever seen she said matteroffact as an accountant but my ma said theres plenty down here She said this whole lake is haunted By the Micmacs that lived here until they was driven out by General Wing by all the men who went away to the Civil War and died there  over six hundred went from this part of the world Mr Noonan and less than a hundred and fifty came back    at least in their bodies Ma said this side of Dark Scores also haunted by the ghost of that Negro boy who died here poor tyke He belonged to one of the RedTops you know No  I know about Sara and the RedTops but not this I paused Did he drown Nawp caught in an animal trap Struggled there for most of a whole day screaming for help Finally they found him They saved the foot but they shouldnt have Bloodpoisoning set in and the boy died Summer of oughtone that was Its why they left I guess  it was too sad to stay But my ma used to claim the little fella he stayed She used to say that hes still on the TR I wondered what Mrs M would say if I told her that the little fella had very likely been here to greet me when I arrived from Derry and had been back on several occasions since Then there was Kenny Austers father Normal she said You know that story dont you Oh thats a terrible story She looked rather pleased  either at knowing such a terrible story or at having the chance to tell it No I said I know Kenny though Hes the one with the wolfhound Blueberry Ayuh He carpenters a tad and caretakes a tad just like his father before him His dad caretook many of these places you know and back just after the Second World War was over Normal Auster drownded Kennys little brother in his back yard This was when they lived on Wasp Hill down where the road splits one side going to the old boatlandin and the other to the marina He didnt drown the tyke in the lake though He put him on the ground under the pump and just held him there until the baby was full of water and dead I stood there looking at her the clothes behind us snapping on their whirligig I thought of my mouth and nose and throat full of that cold mineral taste that could have been wellwater as well as lakewater down here all of it comes from the same deep aquifers I thought of the message on the refrigerator help im drown He left the baby laying right under the pump He had a new Chevrolet and he drove it down here to Lane Fortytwo Took his shotgun too You arent going to tell me Kenny Austers dad committed suicide in my house are you Mrs Meserve She shook her head Nawp He did it on the Brickers lakeside deck Sat down on their porch glider and blew his damned babymurdering head off The Brickers I dont   You wouldnt Hasnt been any Brickers on the lake since the sixties They were from Delaware Quality folks Youd think of it as the Warshburn place I guess although theyre gone now too Place is empty Every now and then that stark naturalborn fool Osgood brings someone down and shows it off but hell never sell it at the price hes asking Mark my words The Washburns I had known  had played bridge with them a time or two Nice enough people although probably not what Mrs M with her queer backcountry snobbishness would have called quality Their place was maybe an eighth of a mile north of mine along The Street Past that point theres nothing much  the drop to the lake gets steep and the woods are massed tangles of second growth and blackberry bushes The Street goes on to the tip of Halo Bay at the far north end of Dark Score but once Lane Fortytwo curves back to the highway the path is for the most part used only by berrypicking expeditions in the summer and hunters in the fall Normal I thought Hell of a name for a guy who had drowned his infant son under the backyard pump Did he leave a note Any explanation Nawp But youll hear folks say he haunts the lake too Little towns are most likely full of haunts but I couldnt say aye no or maybe myself I aint the sensitive type All I know about your place Mr Noonan is that it smells damp no matter how much I try to get it aired out I magine thats logs Log buildins dont go well with lakes The damp gets into the wood She had set her purse down between her Reeboks now she bent and picked it up It was a countrywomans purse black styleless except for the gold grommets holding the handles on and utilitarian She could have carried a good selection of kitchen appliances in there if she had wanted to I cant stand here natterin all day long though much as I might like to I got one more place to go before I can call it quits Summers havest time in this part of the world you know Now remember to take those clothes in before dark Mr Noonan Dont let em get all dewy I wont And I didnt But when I went out to take them in dressed in my bathing trunks and coated with sweat from the oven Id been working in I had to get the air conditioner fixed just had to I saw that something had altered Mrs Ms arrangements My jeans and shirts now hung around the pole The underwear and socks which had been decorously hidden when Mrs M drove up the driveway in her old Ford were now on the outside It was as if my unseen guest  one of my unseen guests  was saying ha ha ha I went to the library the next day and made renewing my library card my first order of business Lindy Briggs herself took my four bucks and entered me into the computer first telling me how sorry she had been to hear about Jos death And as with Bill I sensed a certain reproach in her tone as if I were to blame for such improperly delayed condolences I supposed I was Lindy do you have a town history I asked when we had finished the proprieties concerning my wife We have two she said then leaned toward me over the desk a little woman in a violently patterned sleeveless dress her hair a gray puffball around her head her bright eyes swimming behind her bifocals In a confidential voice she added Neither is much good Which one is better I asked matching her tone Probably the one by Edward Osteen He was a summer resident until the midfifties and lived here fulltime when he retired He wrote Dark Score Days in  or  He had it privately published because he couldnt find a commercial house that would take it Even the regional publishers passed She sighed The locals bought it but thats not many books is it No I suppose not I said He just wasnt much of a writer Not much of a photographer either  those little blackandwhite snaps of his make my eyes hurt Still he tells some good stories The Micmac Drive General Wings trick horse the twister in the eighteeneighties the fires in the nineteenthirties     Anything about Sara and the RedTops She nodded smiling Finally got around to looking up the history of your own place did you Im glad to hear it He found an old photo of them and its in there He thought it was taken at the Fryeburg Fair in  Ed used to say hed give a lot to hear a record made by that bunch So would I but none were ever made A haiku by the Greek poet George Seferis suddenly occurred to me Are these the voices of our dead friends  or just the gramophone What happened to Mr Osteen I dont recall the name Died not a year or two before you and Jo bought your place on the lake she said Cancer You said there were two histories The other one you probably know  A History of Castle County and Castle Rock Done for the county centennial and dry as dust Eddie Osteens book isnt very well written but he wasnt dry You have to give him that much You should find them both over there She pointed to shelves with a sign over them which read of OF MAINE INTEREST They dont circulate Then she brightened Although we will happily take any nickels you should feel moved to feed into our photocopy machine Mattie was sitting in the far corner next to a boy in a turnedaround baseball cap showing him how to use the microfilm reader She looked up at me smiled and mouthed the words Nice catch Referring to my lucky grab at Warringtons presumably I gave a modest little shrug before turning to the OF MAINE INTEREST shelves But she was right  lucky or not it had been a nice catch What are you looking for I was so deep into the two histories Id found that Matties voice made me jump I turned around and smiled first aware that she was wearing some light and pleasant perfume second that Lindy Briggs was watching us from the main desk her welcoming smile put away Background on the area where I live I said Old stories My housekeeper got me interested Then in a lower voice Teachers watching Dont look around Mattie looked startled  and I thought a little worried As it turned out she was right to be worried In a voice that was lowpitched yet still designed to carry at least as far as the desk she asked if she could reshelve either book for me I gave her both As she picked them up she said in what was almost a cons whisper That lawyer who represented you last Friday got John a private detective He says they may have found something interesting about the guardian ad litem I walked over to the OF MAINE INTEREST shelves with her hoping I wasnt getting her in trouble and asked if she knew what the something interesting might be She shook her head gave me a professional little librarians smile and I went away On the ride back to the house I tried to think about what Id read but there wasnt much Osteen was a bad writer who had taken bad pictures and while his stories were colorful they were also pretty thin on the ground He mentioned Sara and the RedTops all right but he referred to them as a DixieLand octet and even I knew that wasnt right The RedTops might have played some Dixieland but they had primarily been a blues group Friday and Saturday nights and a gospel group Sunday mornings Osteens twopage summary of the RedTops stay on the TR made it clear that he had heard no one elses covers of Saras tunes He confirmed that a child had died of bloodpoisoning caused by a traphold wound a story which sounded like Brenda Meserves    but why wouldnt it Osteen had likely heard it from Mrs Ms father or grandfather He also said that the boy was Son Tidwells only child and that the guitarplayers real name was Reginald The Tidwells had supposedly drifted north from the whorehouse district of New Orleans  the fabled cribandclub streets which had been known around the turn of the century as Storyville There was no mention of Sara and the RedTops in the more formal history of Castle County and no mention of Kenny Austers drownded little brother in either book Not long before Mattie came over to speak to me Id had a wild idea that Son Tidwell and Sara Tidwell were man and wife and that the little boy not named by Osteen had been their son I found the picture Lindy had mentioned and studied it closely It showed at least a dozen black people standing in a stiff group in front of what looked like a cattle exhibition There was an oldfashioned Ferris wheel in the background It could well have been taken at the Fryeburg Fair and as old and faded as it was it had a simple elemental power that all Osteens own photos put together could not match You have seen photographs of western and Depressionera bandidos that have that same look of eerie truth  stern faces above tight ties and collars eyes not quite lost in the shadows of antique hatbrims Sara stood front and center wearing a black dress and her guitar She was not outright smiling in this picture but there seemed to be a smile in her eyes and I thought they were like the eyes in some paintings the ones that seem to follow you wherever you move in the room I studied the photo and thought of her almost spiteful voice in my dream What do you want to know sugar I suppose I wanted to know about her and the others  who they had been what they were to each other when they werent singing and playing why theyd left where theyd gone Both of her hands were clearly visible one posed on the strings of her guitar the other on the frets where she had been making a Gchord on an October Fairday in the year  Her fingers were long artistic bare of rings That didnt necessarily mean that she and Son Tidwell werent married of course and even if they hadnt been the little boy whod been caught in the trap could have been born on the wrong side of the blanket Except the same ghost of a smile lurked in Son Tidwells eyes The resemblance was remarkable I had an idea that the two of them had been brother and sister not man and wife I thought about these things on my way home and I thought about cables that were felt rather than seen    but mostly I found myself thinking about Lindy Briggs  the way she had smiled at me the way a little later on she had not smiled at her bright young librarian with the highschool certification That worried me Then I got back to the house and all I worried about was my story and the people in it  bags of bones which were putting on flesh daily Michael Noonan Max Devore and Rogette Whitmore played out their horrible little comedy scene Friday evening Two other things which bear narrating happened before that The first was a call from John Storrow on Thursday night I was sitting in front of the TV with a baseball game running soundlessly in front of me the MUTE button with which most remote controls come equipped may be the twentieth centurys finest invention I was thinking about Sara Tidwell and Son Tidwell and Son Tidwells little boy I was thinking about Storyville a name any writer just had to love And in the back of my mind I was thinking about my wife who had died pregnant Hello I said Mike I have some wonderful news John said He sounded near to bursting Romeo Bissonette may be a weird name but theres nothing weird about the detectiveguy he found for me His name is George Kennedy like the actor Hes good and hes fast This guy could work in New York If thats the highest compliment you can think of you need to get out of the city more He went on as if he hadnt heard Kennedys real job is with a security firm  the other stuff is strictly in the moonlight Which is a great loss believe me He got most of this on the phone I cant believe it What specifically cant you believe Jackpot baby Again he spoke in that tone of greedy satisfaction which I found both troubling and reassuring Elmer Durgin has done the following things since late May paid off his car paid off his camp in Rangely Lakes caught up on about ninety years of child support   Nobody pays child support for ninety years I said but I was just running my mouth to hear it go    to let off some of my own building excitement in truth Taint possible Mcgee It is if you have seven kids John said and began howling with laughter I thought of the pudgy selfsatisfied face the cupidbow mouth the nails that looked polished and prissy He dont I said He do John said still laughing He sounded like a complete lunatic  manic hold the depressive He really do Ranging in ages from ffourteen to thththree What a bbusy pppotent little prick he must have More helpless howls And by now I was howling right along with him  Id caught it like the mumps Kennedy is going to fffax me ppictures of the whole    fam    damily We broke up completely laughing together longdistance I could picture John Storrow sitting alone in his Park Avenue office bellowing like a lunatic and scaring the cleaning ladies That doesnt matter though he said when he could talk coherently again You see what matters dont you Yes I said How could he be so stupid Meaning Durgin but also meaning Devore John understood I think that we were talking about both hes at the same time Elmer Durgins a little lawyer from a little township tucked away in the big woods of western Maine thats all How could he know that some guardian angel would come along with the resources to smoke him out He also bought a boat by the way Two weeks ago Its a twin outboard A big un Its over Mike The home team scores nine runs in the bottom of the ninth and the fucking pennant is ours If you say so But my hand went off on its own expedition made a loose fist and knocked on the good solid wood of the coffeetable And hey the softball game wasnt a total loss John was still talking between little giggling outbursts like helium balloons No Im taken with her Her Mattie he said patiently Mattie Devore A pause then Mike Are you there Yeah I said Phone slipped Sorry The phone hadnt slipped as much as an inch but it came out sounding natural enough I thought And if it hadnt so what When it came to Mattie I would be  in Johns mind at least  below suspicion Like the countryhouse staff in an Agatha Christie He was twentyeight maybe thirty The idea that a man twelve years older might be sexually attracted to Mattie had probably never crossed his mind    or maybe just for a second or two there on the common before he dismissed it as ludicrous The way Mattie herself had dismissed the idea of Jo and the man in the brown sportcoat I cant do my courtship dance while Im representing her he said wouldnt be ethical Wouldnt be safe either Later though    you can never tell No I said hearing my voice as you sometimes do in moments when you are caught completely fiatfooted hearing it as though it were coming from someone else Someone on the radio or the recordplayer maybe Are these the voices of our dead friends or just the gramophone I thought of his hands the fingers long and slender and without a ring on any of them Like Saras hands in that old photo No you can never tell We said goodbye and I sat watching the muted baseball game I thought about getting up to get a beer but it seemed too far to the refrigerator  a safari in fact What I felt was a kind of dull hurt followed by a better emotion rueful relief I guess youd call it Was he too old for her No I didnt think so Just about right Prince Charming No  this time in a threepiece suit Matties luck with men might finally be changing and if so I should be glad I would be glad And relieved Because I had a book to write and never mind the look of white sneakers flashing below a red sundress in the deepening gloom or the ember of her cigarette dancing in the dark Still I felt really lonely for the first time since I saw Kyra marching up the white line of Route  in her bathing suit and flipflops You funny little man said Strickland I told the empty room It came out before I knew I was going to say anything and when it did the channel on the TV changed It went from baseball to a rerun of All in the Family and then to Ren  Stimpy I glanced down at the remote control It was still on the coffeetable where Id left it The TV channel changed again and this time I was looking at Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman There was an airplane in the background and I didnt need to pick up the remote and turn on the sound to know that Humphrey was telling Ingrid that she was getting on that plane My wifes alltime favorite movie She bawled at the end without fail Jo I asked Are you here Bunters bell rang once Very faintly There had been several presences in the house I was sure of it    but tonight for the first time I was positive it was Jo who was with me Who was he hon I asked The guy at the softball field who was he Bunters bell hung still and quiet She was in the room though I sensed her something like a held breath I remembered the ugly gibing little message on the refrigerator after my dinner with Mattie and Ki blue rose liar ha ha Who was he My voice was unsteady sounding on the verge of tears What were you doing down here with some guy Were you     But I couldnt bring myself to ask if she had been lying to me cheating on me I couldnt ask even though the presence I felt might be lets face it only in my own head The TV switched away from Casablanca and here was everybodys favorite lawyer Perry Mason on Nick at Nite Perrys nemesis Hamilton Burger was questioning a distraughtlooking woman and all at once the sound blared on making me jump I am not a liar some longago TV actress cried For a moment she looked right out at me and I was stunned breathless to see Jos eyes in that blackandwhite fifties face I never lied Mr Burger never I submit that you did Burger responded He moved in on her leering like a vampire I submit that you   The TV suddenly went off Bunters bell gave a single brisk shake and then whatever had been here was gone But I felt better I am not a liar    I never lied never I could believe that if I chose to If I chose I went to bed and there were no dreams I had taken to starting work early before the heat could really get a hold on the study Id drink some juice gobble some toast then sit behind the IBM until almost noon watching the Courier ball dance and twirl as the pages floated through the machine and came out with writing on them That old magic so strange and wonderful It never really felt like work to me although I called it that it felt like some weird kind of mental trampoline I bounced on Those were springs that took away all the weight of the world for awhile At noon Id break drive down to Buddy Jellisons greaseatorium for something nasty then return and work for another hour or so After that I would swim and take a long dreamless nap in the north bedroom I had barely poked my head into the master bedroom at the south end of the house and if Mrs M thought this was odd she kept it to herself On Friday the seventeenth I stopped at the Lakeview General on my way back to the house to gas up my Chevrolet There are pumps at the AllPurpose Garage and the gojuice was a penny or two cheaper but I didnt like the vibe Today as I stood in front of the store with the pump on automatic feed looking off toward the mountains Bill Deans Dodge Ram pulled in on the other side of the island He climbed down and gave me a smile Hows it going Mike Pretty fair Brenda says youre writin up a storm I am I said and it was on the tip of my tongue to ask for an update on the broken secondfloor air conditioner The tip of my tongue was where it stayed I was still too nervous about my rediscovered ability to want to change anything about the environment in which I was doing it Stupid maybe but sometimes things work just because you think they work Its as good a definition of faith as any Well Im glad to hear it Very glad I thought he was sincere enough but he somehow didnt sound like Bill Not the one who had greeted me back anyway Ive been looking up some old stuff about my side of the lake I said Sara and the RedTops You always were sort ofintrested in them I remember Them yes but not just them Lots of history I was talking to Mrs M and she told me about Normal Auster Kennys father Bills smile stayed on and he only paused a moment in the act of unscrewing the cap on his gas tank but I still had a sense quite clear that he had frozen inside You wouldnt write about a thing like that would you Mike Because theres a lot of people around here thatd feel it bad and take it wrong I told Jo the same thing Jo I felt an urge to step between the two pumps and over the island so I could grab him by the arm Whats Jo got to do with this He looked at me cautiously and long She didnt tell you What are you talking about She thought she might write something about Sara and the RedTops for one of the local papers Bill was picking his words very slowly I have a clear memory of that and of how hot the sun was beating down on my neck and the sharpness of our shadows on the asphalt He began to pump his gas and the sound of the pumps motor was also very sharp I think she even mentioned Yankee magazine I cd be wrong about that but I dont think I am I was speechless Why would she have kept quiet about the idea to try her hand at a little local history Because she might have thought she was poaching on my territory That was ridiculous She had known me better than that    hadnt she When did you have this conversation Bill Do you remember Coss I do he said Same day she come down to take delivery of those plastic owls Only I raised the subject because folks had told me she was asking around Prying I didnt say that he said stiffly you did True but I thought prying was what he meant Go on Nothing to go on about I told her there were sore toes here and there on the TR same as there are anyplace and ast her not to tread on any corns if she could help it She said she understood Maybe she did maybe she didnt All I know is she kep on asking questions Listenin to stories from old fools with more time than sense When was this Fall of  winter and spring of  Went all around town she did even over to Motton and Harlow  with her notebook and little taperecorder Anyway thats all I know I realized a stunning thing Bill was lying If youd asked me before that day Id have laughed and told you Bill Dean didnt have a lie in him And he must not have had many because he did it badly I thought of calling him on it but to what end I needed to think and I couldnt do it here  my mind was roaring Given time that roar might subside and Id see it was really nothing no big deal but I needed that time When you start finding out unexpected things about a loved one whos been dead awhile it rocks you Take it from me it does Bills eyes had shifted away from mine but now they shifted back He looked both earnest and  I could have sworn it  a little scared She ast about little Kerry Auster and thats a good example of what I mean about steppin on sore toes Thats not the stuff for a newspaper story or a magazine article Normal just snapped No one knows why It was a terrible tragedy senseless and theres still people who could be hurt by it In little towns things are kind of connected under the surface   Yes like cables you couldnt quite see   and the past dies slower Sara and those others thats a little different They were just    just wanderers    from away Jo could have stuck to those folks and it wouldve been all right And say  for all I know she did Because I never saw a single word she ever wrote If she did write About that he was telling the truth I felt But I knew something else knew it as surely as Id known Mattie had been wearing white shorts when she called me on her day off Sara and those others were just wanderers from away Bill had said but he hesitated in the middle of his thought substituting wanderers for the word which had come naturally to mind Niggers was the word he hadnt said Sara and those others were just niggers from away All at once I found myself thinking of an old story by Ray Bradbury Mars Is Heaven The first space travellers to Mars discover its Green Town Illinois and all their wellloved friends and relatives are there Only the friends and relatives are really alien monsters and in the night while the space travellers think they are sleeping in the beds of their longdead kinfolk in a place that must be heaven they are slaughtered to the last man Bill youre sure she was up here a few times in the offseason Ayuh Twasnt just a few times either Might have been a dozen times or more Daytrips dont you know Did you ever see a fellow with her Burly guy black hair He thought about it I tried not to hold my breath At last he shook his head Few times I saw her she was alone But I didnt see her every time she came Sometimes I only heard shed been on the TR after she us gone again Saw her in June of  headed up toward Halo Bay in that little car a hers She waved I waved back Went down to the house later that evenin to see if she needed anythin but shed gone I didnt see her again When she died later on that summer me and Vette were so shocked Whatever she was looking for she must never have written any of it down I would have found the manuscript Was that true though She had made many trips down here with no apparent attempts at concealment on one of them she had even been accompanied by a strange man and I had only found out about these visits by accident This is hard to talk about Bill said but since weve gotten started hard we might as well go the rest of the way Livin on the TR is like the way we used to sleep four or even five in a bed when it was January and true cold If everyone rests easy you do all right But if one person gets restless gets tossing and turning no one can sleep Right now youre the restless one Thats how people see it He waited to see what Id say When almost twenty seconds passed without a word from me Harold Oblowski would have been proud he shuffled his feet and went on There are people in town uneasy about the interest youve taken in Mattie Devore for instance Now Im not sayin theres anythin going on between the two of you  although theres folks who do say it  but if you want to stay on the TR youre makin it tough on yourself Why Comes back to what I said a week and a half ago Shes trouble As I recall Bill you said she was in trouble And she is Im trying to help her out of it Theres nothing going on between us but that I seem to recall telling you that Max Devore is nuts he said If you make him mad we all pay the price The pump clicked off and he racked it up Then he sighed raised his hands dropped them You think this is easy for me to say You think its easy for me to listen to All right ayuh were in the same skiff But Mattie Devore isnt the only person on the TR livin handtomouth you know Theres others got their woes as well Cant you understand that Maybe he saw that I understood too much and too well because his shoulders slumped If youre asking me to stand aside and let Devore take Matties baby without a fight you can forget it I said And I hope thats not it Because I think Id have to be quits with a man whod ask another man to do something like that I wouldnt ask it now anywise he said his accent thickening almost to the point of contempt Itd be too late wouldnt it And then unexpectedly he softened Christ man Im worried about you Let the rest of it go hang all right Hang high where the crows can pick it He was lying again but this time I didnt mind so much because I thought he was lying to himself But you need to have a care When I said Devore was crazy that was no figure of speech Do you think hell bother with court if court cant get him what he wants Folks died in those summer fires back in  Good people One related to me They burned over half the goddam county and Max Devore set em That was his goingaway present to the TR It could never be proved but he did it Back then he was young and broke not yet twenty and no law in his pocket What do you think hed do now He looked at me searchingly I said nothing Bill nodded as if I had spoken Think about it And you remember this Mike no man who didnt care for you would ever talk to you straight as I have How straight was that Bill I was faintly aware of some tourist walking from his Volvo to the store and looking at us curiously and when I replayed the scene in my mind later on I realized we must have looked like guys on the verge of a fistfight I remember that I felt like crying out of sadness and bewilderment and an incompletely defined sense of betrayal but I also remember being furious with this lanky old man  him in his shiningclean cotton undershirt and his mouthful of false teeth So maybe we were close to fighting and I just didnt know it at the time Straight as I could be he said and turned away to go inside and pay for his gas My house is haunted I said He stopped back to me shoulders hunched as if to absorb a blow Then slowly he turned back Sara Laughs has always been haunted Mike Youve stirred em up Praps you should go back to Derry and let em settle That might be the best thing He paused as if replaying this last to see if he agreed with it then nodded He nodded as slowly as he had turned Ayuh that might be best all around When I got back to Sara I called Ward Hankins Then I finally made that call to Bonnie Amudson Part of me was rooting for her not to be in at the travel agency in Augusta she coowned but she was Halfway through my talk with her the fax began to print out xeroxed pages from Jos appointment calendars On the first one Ward had scrawled Hope this helps I didnt rehearse what I was going to say to Bonnie I felt that to do so would be a recipe for disaster I told her that Jo had been writing something  maybe an article maybe a series of them  about the township where our summerhouse was located and that some of the locals had apparently been cheesed off by her curiosity Some still were Had she talked to Bonnie Perhaps showed her an early draft No huhuh Bonnie sounded honestly surprised She used to show me her photos and more herb samples than I honestly cared to see but she never showed me anything she was writing In fact I remember her once saying that shed decided to leave the writing to you and just     take a little taste of everything else right Yes I thought this was a good place to end the conversation but the guys in the basement seemed to have other ideas Was she seeing anyone Bonnie Silence from the other end With a hand that seemed at least four miles down my arm I plucked the fax sheets out of the basket Ten of them  November of  to August of  Jottings everywhere in Jos neat hand Had we even had a fax before she died I couldnt remember There was so fucking much I couldnt remember Bonnie If you know something please tell me Jos dead but Im not I can forgive her if I have to but I cant forgive what I dont underst   Im sorry she said and gave a nervous little laugh Its just that I didnt understand at first Seeing anyone that was just so    so foreign to Jo    the Jo I knew    that I couldnt figure out what you were talking about I thought maybe you meant a shrink but you didnt did you You meant seeing someone like seeing a guy A boyfriend Thats what I meant Thumbing through the faxed calendar sheets now my hand not quite back to its proper distance from my eyes but getting there getting there I felt relief at the honest bewilderment in Bonnies voice but not as much as Id expected Because Id known I hadnt even needed the woman in the old Perry Mason episode to put in her two cents not really It was Jo we were talking about after all Jo Mike Bonnie was saying very softly as if I might be crazy she loved you She loved you Yes I suppose she did The calendar pages showed how busy my wife had been How productive SKs of Maine    the soup kitchens WomShel a countytocounty network of shelters for battered women TeenShel Friends of Me Libes She had been at two or three meetings a month  two or three a week at some points  and Id barely noticed I had been too busy with my women in jeopardy I loved her too Bonnie but she was up to something in the last ten months of her life She didnt give you any hint of what it might have been when you were riding to meetings of the Soup Kitchens board or the Friends of Maine Libraries Silence from the other end Bonnie I took the phone away from my ear to see if the red LOW BATTERY light was on and it squawked my name I put it back Bonnie what is it There were no long drives those last nine or ten months We talked on the phone and I remember once we had lunch in Waterville but there were no long drives She quit I thumbed through the faxsheets again Meetings noted everywhere in Jos neat hand Soup Kitchens of Maine among them I dont understand She quit the Soup Kitchens board Another moment of silence Then speaking carefully No Mike She quit all of them She finished with Woman Shelters and Teen Shelters at the end of   her term was up then The other two Soup Kitchens and Friends of Maine Libraries    she resigned in October or November of  Meetings noted on all the sheets Ward had sent me Dozens of them Meetings in  meetings in  Meetings of boards to which shed no longer belonged She had been down here On all those supposed meetingdays Jo had been on the TR I would have bet my life on it But why Devore was mad all right mad as a hatter and he couldnt have caught me at a worse weaker more terrified moment And I think that everything from that moment on was almost preordained From there to the terrible storm they still talk about in this part of the world it all came down like a rockslide I felt fine the rest of Friday afternoon my talk with Bonnie left a lot of questions unanswered but it had been a tonic just the same I made a vegetable stirfry atonement for my latest plunge into the FryOLator at the Village Cafe and ate it while I watched the evening news On the other side of the lake the sun was sliding down toward the mountains and flooding the living room with gold When Tom Brokaw closed up shop I decided to take a walk north along The Street  Id go as far as I could and still be assured of getting home by dark and as I went Id think about the things Bill Dean and Bonnie Amudson had told me Id think about them the way I sometimes walked and thought about plotsnags in whatever I was working on I walked down the railroadtie steps still feeling perfectly fine confused but fine started off along The Street then paused to look at the Green Lady Even with the evening sun shining fully upon her it was hard to see her for what she actually was  just a birch tree with a halfdead pine standing behind it one branch of the latter making a pointing arm It was as if the Green Lady were saying go north young man go north Well I wasnt exactly young but I could go north all right For awhile at least Yet I stood a moment longer uneasily studying the face I could see in the bushes not liking the way the little shake of breeze seemed to make what was nearly a mouth sneer and grin I think perhaps I started to feel a little bad then was too preoccupied to notice it I set off north wondering what exactly Jo might have written    for by then I was starting to believe she might have written something after all Why else had I found my old typewriter in her studio I would go through the place I decided I would go through it carefully and    help im drown The voice came from the woods the water from myself A wave of lightheadedness passed through my thoughts lifting and scattering them like leaves in a breeze I stopped All at once I had never felt so bad so blighted in my life My chest was tight My stomach folded in on itself like a cold flower My eyes filled with chilly water that was nothing like tears and I knew what was coming No I tried to say but the word wouldnt come out My mouth filled with the cold taste of lakewater instead all those dark minerals and suddenly the trees were shimmering before my eyes as if I were looking up at them through clear liquid and the pressure on my chest had become dreadfully localized and taken the shapes of hands They were holding me down Wont it stop doing that someone asked  almost cried There was no one on The Street but me yet I heard that voice clearly Wont it ever stop doing that What came next was no outer voice but alien thoughts in my own head They beat against the walls of my skull like moths trapped inside a lightfixture    or inside a Japanese lantern help Im drown help Im drown bluecap man say git me bluecap man say dassnt let me ramble help Im drown lost my berries they on the path he holdin me he face shimmer n look bad lemme up lemme up  sweet Jesus lemme up oxen free allee allee oxen free PLEASE OXEN FREE you go on and stop now ALLEE OXEN FREE she scream my name she scream it so LOUD I bent forward in an utter panic opened my mouth and from my gaping straining mouth there poured a cold flood of    Nothing at all The horror of it passed and yet it didnt pass I still felt terribly sick to my stomach as if I had eaten something to which my body had taken a violent offense some kind of antpowder or maybe a killer mushroom the kind Jos fungi guides pictured inside red borders I staggered forward half a dozen steps gagging dryly from a throat which still believed it was wet There was another birch where the bank dropped to the lake arching its white belly gracefully over the water as if to see its reflection by evenings flattering light I grabbed it like a drunk grabbing a lamppost The pressure in my chest began to ease but it left an ache as real as rain I hung against the tree heart fluttering and suddenly I became aware that something stank  an evil polluted smell worse than a clogged septic pool which has simmered all summer under the blazing sun With it was a sense of some hideous presence giving off that odor something which should have been dead and wasnt Oh stop allee allee oxen free Ill do anything only stop I tried to say and still nothing came out Then it was gone I could smell nothing but the lake and the woods    but I could see something a boy in the lake a little drowned dark boy lying on his back His cheeks were puffed out His mouth hung slackly open His eyes were as white as the eyes of a statue My mouth filled with the unmerciful iron of the lake again Help me lemme up help Im drown I leaned out screaming inside my head screaming down at the dead face and I realized I was looking up at myself looking up through the roseshimmer of sunset water at a white man in blue jeans and a yellow polo shirt holding onto a trembling birch and trying to scream his liquid face in motion his eyes momentarily blotted out by the passage of a small perch coursing after a tasty bug I was both the dark boy and the white man drowned in the water and drowning in the air is this right is this whats happening tap once for yes twice for no I retched nothing but a single runner of spit and impossibly a fish jumped at it Theyll jump at almost anything at sunset something in the dying light must make them crazy The fish hit the water again about seven feet from the bank spanking out a circular silver ripple and it was gone  the taste in my mouth the horrible smell the shimmering drowned face of the Negro child  a Negro that was how he would have thought of himself whose name had almost surely been Tidwell I looked to my right and saw a gray forehead of rock poking out of the mulch I thought There right there and as if in confirmation that horrible putrescent smell puffed at me again seemingly from the ground I closed my eyes still hanging onto the birch for dear life feeling weak and sick and ill and that was when Max Devore that madman spoke from behind me Say there whoremaster wheres your whore I turned and there he was with Rogette Whitmore by his side It was the only time I ever met him but once was enough Believe me once was more than enough His wheelchair hardly looked like a wheelchair at all What it looked like was a motorcycle sidecar crossed with a lunar lander Half a dozen chrome wheels ran along both sides Bigger wheels  four of them I think  ran in a row across the back None looked to be exactly on the same level and I realized each was tied into its own suspensionbed Devore would have a smooth ride over ground a lot rougher than The Street Above the back wheels was an enclosed engine compartment Hiding Devores legs was a fiberglass nacelle black with red pinstriping that would not have looked out of place on a racing car Implanted in the center of it was a gadget that looked like my DSS satellite dish    some sort of computerized avoidance system I guessed Maybe even an autopilot The armrests were wide and covered with controls Holstered on the left side of this machine was a green oxygen tank four feet long A hose went to a clear plastic accordion tube the accordion tube led to a mask which rested in Devores lap It made me think of the old guys Stenomask Coming on the heels of what had just happened I might have considered this Tom Clancyish vehicle a hallucination except for the bumpersticker on the nacelle below the dish I BLEED DODGER BLUE it said This evening the woman I had seen outside The Sunset Bar at Warringtons was wearing a white blouse with long sleeves and black pants so tapered they made her legs look like sheathed swords Her narrow face and hollow cheeks made her resemble Edvard Munchs screamer more than ever Her white hair hung around her face in a lank cowl Her lips were painted so brightly red she seemed to be bleeding from the mouth She was old and she was ugly but she was a prize compared to Matties fatherinlaw Scrawny bluelipped the skin around his eyes and the corners of his mouth a dark exploded purple he looked like something an archeologist might find in the burial room of a pyramid surrounded by his stuffed wives and pets bedizened with his favorite jewels A few wisps of white hair still clung to his scaly skull more tufts sprang from enormous ears which seemed to have melted like wax sculptures left out in the sun He was wearing white cotton pants and a billowy blue shirt Add a little black beret and he would have looked like a French artist from the nineteenth century at the end of a very long life Across his lap was a cane of some black wood Snugged over the end was a bright red bicycle grip The fingers grasping it looked powerful but they were going as black as the cane itself His circulation was failing and I couldnt imagine what his feet and his lower legs must look like Whore run off and left you has she I tried to say something A croak came out of my mouth nothing more I was still holding the birch I let go of it and tried to straighten up but my legs were still weak and I had to grab it again He nudged a silver toggle switch and the chair came ten feet closer halving the distance between us The sound it made was a silky whisper watching it was like watching an evil magic carpet Its many wheels rose and fell independent of one another and flashed in the declining sun which had begun to take on a reddish cast And as he came closer I felt the sense of the man His body was rotting out from under him but the force around him was undeniable and daunting like an electrical storm The woman paced beside him regarding me with silent amusement Her eyes were pinkish I assumed then that they were gray and had picked up a bit of the coming sunset but I think now she was an albino I always liked a whore he said He drew the word out making it horrrrrrr Didnt I Rogette Yes sir she said In their place Sometimes their place was on my face he cried with a kind of insane perkiness as if she had contradicted him Where is she young man Whose face is she sitting on right now I wonder That smart lawyer you found Oh I know all about him right down to the Unsatisfactory Conduct he got in the third grade I make it my business to know things Its the secret of my success With an enormous effort I straightened up What are you doing here Having a constitutional same as you And no law against it is there The Street belongs to anyone who wants to use it You havent been here long young whoremaster but surely youve been here long enough to know that Its our version of the town common where good pups and vile dogs may walk sidebyside Once more using the hand not bunched around the red bicycle grip he picked up the oxygen mask sucked deeply then dropped it back in his lap He grinned  an unspeakable grin of complicity that revealed gums the color of iodine She good That little horrrrrr of yours She must be good to have kept my son prisoner in that nasty little trailer where she lives And then along comes you even before the worms had finished with my boys eyes Does her cunt suck Shut up Rogette Whitmore threw back her head and laughed The sound was like the scream of a rabbit caught in an owls talons and my flesh crawled I had an idea she was as crazy as he was Thank God they were old You struck a nerve there Max she said What do you want I took a breath    and caught a taste of that putrescence again I gagged I didnt want to but I couldnt help it Devore straightened in his chair and breathed deeply as if to mock me In that moment he looked like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now striding along the beach and telling the world how much he loved the smell of napalm in the morning His grin widened Lovely place just here isnt it A cozy spot to stop and think wouldnt you say He looked around This is where it happened all right Ayuh Where the boy drowned I thought Whitmores smile looked momentarily uneasy at that Devore didnt He clutched for his translucent oxygen mask with an old mans overwide grip fingers that grope rather than reach I could see little bubbles of mucus clinging to the inside He sucked deep again put it down again Thirty or more folks have drowned in this lake and thats just the ones they know about he said Whats one boy more or less I dont get it Were there two Tidwell boys who died here The one that got bloodpoisoning and the one   Do you care about your soul Mr Noonan Your immortal soul Gods butterfly caught in a cocoon of flesh that will soon stink like mine I said nothing The strangeness of what had happened before he arrived was passing What replaced it was his incredible personal magnetism I have never in my life felt so much raw force There was nothing supernatural about it either and raw is exactly the right word I might have run Under other circumstances Im sure I would have It certainly wasnt bravery that kept me where I was my legs still felt rubbery and I was afraid I might fall down Im going to give you one chance to save your soul Devore said He raised a bony finger to illustrate the concept of one Go away my fine whoremaster Right now in the clothes you stand up in Dont bother to pack a bag dont even stop to make sure you turned off the stoveburners Go Leave the whore and leave the whorelet Leave them to you Ayuh to me Ill do the things that need to be done Souls are for liberal arts majors Noonan I was an engineer Go fuck yourself Rogette Whitmore made that screamingrabbit sound again The old man sat in his chair head lowered grinning sallowly up at me and looking like something raised from the dead Are you sure you want to be the one Noonan It doesnt matter to her you know  you or me its all the same to her I dont know what youre talking about I drew another deep breath and this time the air tasted all right I took a step away from the birch and my legs were all right too And I dont care Youre never getting Kyra Never in what remains of your scaly life Ill never see that happen Pal youll see plenty Devore said grinning and showing me his iodine gums Before Julys done youll likely have seen so much youll wish youd ripped the living eyes out of your head in June Im going home Let me pass Go home then how could I stop you he asked The Street belongs to everyone He groped the oxygen mask out of his lap again and took another healthy pull He dropped it into his lap and settled his left hand on the arm of his Buck Rogers wheelchair I stepped toward him and almost before I knew what was happening he ran the wheelchair at me He could have hit me and hurt me quite badly  broken one or both of my legs I dont doubt  but he stopped just short I leaped back but only because he allowed me to I was aware that Whitmore was laughing again Whats the matter Noonan Get out of my way Im warning you Whore made you jumpy has she I started to my left meaning to go by him on that side but in a flash he had turned the chair shot it forward and cut me off Get out of the TR Noonan Im giving you good ad   I broke to the right this time on the lake side and would have slipped by him quite neatly except for the fist very small and hard that hammered the left side of my face The whitehaired bitch was wearing a ring and the stone cut me behind the ear I felt the sting and the warm flow of blood I pivoted stuck out both hands and pushed her She fell to the needlecarpeted path with a squawk of surprised outrage At the next instant something clouted me on the back of the head A momentary orange glow lit up my sight I staggered backward in what felt like slow motion waving my arms and Devore came into view again He was slued around in his wheelchair scaly head thrust forward the cane hed hit me with still upraised If he had been ten years younger I believe he would have fractured my skull instead of just creating that momentary orange light I ran into my old friend the birch tree I raised my hand to my ear and looked unbelievingly at the blood on the tips of my fingers My head ached from the blow he had fetched me Whitmore was struggling to her feet brushing pine needles from her slacks and looking at me with a furious smile Her cheeks had filled in with a thin pink flush Her toored lips were pulled back to show small teeth In the light of the setting sun her eyes looked as if they were burning Get out of my way I said but my voice sounded small and weak No Devore said and laid the black barrel of his cane on the nacelle that curved over the front of his chair Now I could see the little boy who had been determined to have the sled no matter how badly he cut his hands getting it I could see him very clearly No you whorefucking sissy I wont He shoved the silver toggle switch again and the wheelchair rushed silently at me If I had stayed where I was he would have run me through with his cane as surely as any evil duke was ever run through in an Alexandre Dumas story He probably would have crushed the fragile bones in his right hand and torn his right arm clean out of its socket in the collision but this man had never cared about such things he left costcounting to the little people If I had hesitated out of shock or incredulity he would have killed me Im sure of it Instead I rolled to my left My sneakers slid on the needleslippery embankment for a moment Then they lost contact with the earth and I was falling I hit the water awkwardly and much too close to the bank My left foot struck a submerged root and twisted The pain was huge something that felt like a thunderclap sounds I opened my mouth to scream and the lake poured in  that cold metallic dark taste this time for real I coughed it out and sneezed it out and floundered away from where I had landed thinking The boy the dead boys down here what if he reaches up and grabs me I turned over on my back still flailing and coughing very aware of my jeans clinging clammily to my legs and crotch thinking absurdly about my wallet  I didnt care about the credit cards or drivers license but I had two good snapshots of Jo in there and they would be ruined Devore had almost run himself over the embankment I saw and for a moment I thought he still might go The front of his chair jutted over the place where I had fallen I could see the short tracks of my sneakers just to the left of the bitchs partially exposed roots and although the forward wheels were still grounded the crumbly earth was running out from beneath them in dry little avalanches that rolled down the slope and pitapatted into the water creating interlocking ripple patterns Whitmore was clinging to the back of the chair yanking on it but it was much too heavy for her if Devore was to be saved he would have to save himself Standing waistdeep in the lake with my clothes floating around me I rooted for him to go over The purplish claw of his left hand recaptured the silver toggle switch after several attempts One finger hooked it backward and the chair reversed away from the embankment with a final shower of stones and dirt Whitmore leaped prankishly to one side to keep her feet from being run over Devore fiddled some more with his controls turned the chair to face me where I stood in the water some seven feet out from the overhanging birch and then nudged the chair forward until he was on the edge of The Street but safely away from the drop off Whitmore had turned away from us entirely she was bent over with her butt poking in my direction If I thought about her at all and I cant remember that I did I suppose I thought she was getting her breath back Devore appeared to be in the best shape of the three of us not even needing a hit from the oxygen mask sitting in his lap The late light was full in his face making him look like a halfrotted jackolantern which has been soaked with gas and set on fire Enjoying your swim he asked and laughed I looked around hoping to see a strolling couple or perhaps a fisherman looking for a place where he could wet his line one more time before dark    and yet at the same time I hoped Id see no one I was angry hurt and scared Most of all I was embarrassed I had been dunked in the lake by a man of eightyfive    a man who showed every sign of hanging around and making sport of me I began wading to my right  south back toward my house The water was about waistdeep cool and almost refreshing now that I was used to it My sneakers squelched over rocks and submerged treebranches The ankle Id twisted still hurt but it was supporting me Whether it would continue to once I got out of the lake was another question Devore twiddled his controls some more The chair pivoted and came rolling slowly along The Street keeping pace with me easily I didnt introduce you properly to Rogette did I he said She was quite an athlete in college you know Softball and field hockey were her specialties and shes held onto at least some of her skills Rogette demonstrate your skills for this young man Whitmore passed the slowly moving wheelchair on the left For a moment she was blocked out by it When I could see her again I could also see what she was holding She hadnt been bent over to get her breath Smiling she strode to the edge of the embankment with her left arm curled against her midriff cradling the rocks she had picked up from the edge of the path She selected a chunk roughly the size of a golfball drew her hand back to her ear and threw it at me Hard It whizzed by my left temple and splashed into the water behind me Hey I shouted more startled than afraid Even after everything that had preceded it I couldnt believe this was happening Whats wrong with you Rogette Devore asked chidingly You never used to throw like a girl Get him The second rock passed two inches over my head The third was a potential toothsmasher I batted it away with an angry fearful shout not noticing until later that it had bruised my palm At the moment I was only aware of her hateful smiling face  the face of a woman who has plunked down two dollars in a carny shootingpitch and means to win the big stuffed teddybear even if she has to blast away all night And she threw fast The rocks hailed down around me some splashing into the ruddy water to my left or right creating little geysers I began to backpedal afraid to turn and swim for it afraid that she would throw a really big one the minute I did Still I had to get out of her range Devore meanwhile was laughing a wheezy old mans laugh his wretched face crunched in on itself like the face of a malicious appledoll One of her rocks struck me a hard painful blow on the collarbone and bounced high into the air I cried out and she did too Hai like a karate fighter whos gotten in a good kick So much for orderly retreat I turned swam for deeper water and the bitch brained me The first two rocks she threw after I began to swim seemed to be rangefinders There was a pause when I had time to think Im doing it Im getting beyond her area of    and then something hit the back of my head I felt it and heard it the same way  it went CLONK like something youd read in a Batman comic The surface of the lake went from bright orange to bright red to dark scarlet Faintly I could hear Devore yelling approval and Whitmore squealing her strange laugh I took in another mouthful of irontasting water and was so dazed I had to remind myself to spit it out not swallow it My feet now felt too heavy for swimming and my goddam sneakers weighed a ton I put them down to stand up and couldnt find the bottom  I had gotten beyond my depth I looked in toward the shore It was spectacular blazing in the sunset like stagescenery lit with bright orange and red gels I was probably twenty feet out from the shore now Devore and Whitmore were at the edge of The Street watching They looked like Dad and Mom in a Grant Wood painting Devore was using the mask again but I could see him grinning inside it Whitmore was grinning too More water sloshed in my mouth I spit most of it out but some went down making me cough and halfretch I started to sink below the surface and fought my way back up not swimming but only splashing wildly expending nine times the energy I needed to stay afloat Panic made its first appearance nibbling through my dazed bewilderment with sharp little rat teeth I realized I could hear a high sweet buzzing How many blows had my poor old head taken One from Whitmores fist    one from Devores cane    one rock    or had it been two Christ I couldnt remember Get hold of yourself for Gods sake  youre not going to let him beat you this way are you Drown you like that little boy was drowned No not if I could help it I trod water and ran my left hand down the back of my head Not too far above the nape I encountered a gooseegg that was still rising When I pressed on it the pain made me feel like throwing up and fainting at the same time Tears rose in my eyes and rolled down my cheeks There were only traces of blood on the tips of my fingers when I looked at them but it was hard to tell about cuts when you were in the water You look like a woodchuck caught out in the rain Noonan Now his voice seemed to roll to where I was as if across a great distance Fuck you I called Ill see you in jail for this He looked at Whitmore She looked back with an identical expression and they both laughed If someone had put an Uzi in my hands at that moment I would have killed them both with no hesitation and then asked for a second clip so I could machinegun the bodies With no Uzi to hand I began to dogpaddle south toward my house They paced me along The Street he rolling in his whisperquiet wheelchair she walking beside him as solemn as a nun and pausing every now and then to pick up a likelylooking rock I hadnt swum enough to be tired but I was It was mostly shock I suppose Finally I tried to draw a breath at the wrong time swallowed more water and panicked completely I began to swim in toward the shore wanting to get to where I could stand up Rogette Whitmore began to fire rocks at me immediately first using the ones she had lined up between her left arm and her midriff then those shed stockpiled in Devores lap She was warmed up she wasnt throwing like a girl anymore and her aim was deadly Stones splashed all around me I batted another away  a big one that likely would have cut open my forehead if it had hit  but her followup struck my bicep and tore a long scratch there Enough I rolled over and swam back out beyond her range gasping for breath trying to keep my head up in spite of the growing ache in the back of my neck When I was clear I trod water and looked in at them Whitmore had come all the way to the edge of the embankment wanting to get every foot of distance she could Hell every damned inch Devore was parked behind her in his wheelchair They were both still grinning and now their faces were as red as the faces of imps in hell Red sky at night sailors delight Another twenty minutes and it would be getting dark Could I keep my head above water for another twenty minutes I thought so if I didnt panic again but not much longer I thought of drowning in the dark looking up and seeing Venus just before I went under for the last time and the panicrat slashed me with its teeth again The panicrat was worse than Rogette and her rocks much worse Maybe not worse than Devore I looked both ways along the lakefront checking The Street wherever it wove out of the trees for a dozen feet or a dozen yards I didnt care about being embarrassed anymore but I saw no one Dear God where was everybody Gone to the Mountain View in Fryeburg for pizza or the Village Cafe for milkshakes What do you want I called in to Devore Do you want me to tell you Ill butt out of your business Okay Ill butt out He laughed Well I hadnt expected it to work Even if Id been sincere about it he wouldnt have believed me We just want to see how long you can swim Whitmore said and threw another rock  a long lazy toss that fell about five feet short of where I was They mean to kill me I thought They really do Yes And what was more they might well get away with it A crazy idea both plausible and implausible at the same time rose in my mind I could see Rogette Whitmore tacking a notice to the cOMMUNITY DOINS board outside the Lakeview General Store TO THE MARTIANS OF TR GREETINGS Mr MAXWELL DEVORE everyones favorite Martian will give each resident of the TR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS if no one will use The Street on FRIDAY EVENING THE th OF JULY between the hours of SEVEN and NINE PM Keep our SUMMER FRIENDS away too And remember GOOD MARTIANS are like GOOD MONKEYS they SEE no evil HEAR no evil and SPEAK no evil I couldnt really believe it not even in my current situation    and yet I almost could At the very least I had to grant him the luck of the devil Tired My sneakers heavier than ever I tried to push one of them off and succeeded only in taking in another mouthful of lakewater They stood watching me Devore occasionally picking the mask up from his lap and having a revivifying suck I couldnt wait until dark The sun exits in a hurry here in western Maine  as it does I guess in mountain country everywhere  but the twilights are long and lingering By the time it got dark enough in the west to move without being seen the moon would have risen in the east I found myself imagining my obituary in the New York Times the headline reading POPULAR ROMANTIC SUSPENSE NOVELIST DROWNS IN MAINE Debra Weinstock would provide them with the author photo from the forthcoming Helens Promise Harold Oblowski would say all the right things and hed also remember to put a modest but not tiny death notice in Publishers Weekly He would go halfandhalf with Putnam on it and  I sank swallowed more water and spat it out I began pummelling the lake again and forced myself to stop From the shore I could hear Rogette Whitmores tinkling laughter You bitch I thought you scrawny bi  Mike Jo said Her voice was in my head but it wasnt the one I make when Im imagining her side of a mental dialogue or when I just miss her and need to whistle her up for awhile As if to underline this something splashed to my right splashed hard When I looked in that direction I saw no fish not even a ripple What I saw instead was our swimming float anchored about a hundred yards away in the sunsetcolored water I cant swim that far baby I croaked Did you say something Noonan Devore called from the shore He cupped a mocking hand to one of his huge waxlump ears Couldnt quite make it out You sound all out of breath More tinkling laughter from Whitmore He was Johnny Carson she was Ed Mcmahon You can make it Ill help you The float I realized might be my only chance  there wasnt another one on this part of the shore and it was at least ten yards beyond Whitmores longest rockshot so far I began to dogpaddle in that direction my arms now as leaden as my feet Each time I felt my head on the verge of going under I paused treading water telling myself to take it easy I was in pretty good shape and doing okay telling myself that if I didnt panic Id be all right The old bitch and the even older bastard resumed pacing me but they saw where I was headed and the laughter stopped So did the taunts For a long time the swimming float seemed to draw no closer I told myself that was just because the light was fading the color of the water draining from red to purple to a nearblack that was the color of Devores gums but I was able to muster less and less conviction for this idea as my breath shortened and my arms grew heavier When I was still thirty yards away a cramp struck my left leg I rolled sideways like a swamped sailboat trying to reach the bunched muscle More water poured down my throat I tried to cough it out then retched and went under with my stomach still trying to heave and my fingers still looking for the knotted place above the knee Im really drowning I thought strangely calm now that it was happening This is how it happens this is it Then I felt a hand seize me by the nape of the neck The pain of having my hair yanked brought me back to reality in a flash  it was better than an epinephrine injection I felt another hand clamp around my left leg there was a brief but terrific sense of heat The cramp let go and I broke the surface swimming  really swimming this time not just dogpaddling and in what seemed like seconds I was clinging to the ladder on the side of the float breathing in great snatching gasps waiting to see if I was going to be all right or if my heart was going to detonate in my chest like a hand grenade At last my lungs started to overcome my oxygen debt and everything began to calm down I gave it another minute then climbed out of the water and into what was now the ashes of twilight I stood facing west for a little while bent over with my hands on my knees dripping on the boards Then I turned around meaning this time to flip them not just a single bird but that fabled double eagle There was no one to flip it to The Street was empty Devore and Rogette Whitmore were gone Maybe they were gone Id do well to remember there was a lot of Street I couldnt see I sat crosslegged on the float until the moon rose waiting and watching for any movement Half an hour I think Maybe fortyfive minutes I checked my watch but got no help there it had shipped some water and stopped at  PM To the other satisfactions Devore owed me I could now add the price of one Timex Indiglo  thats  asshole cough it up At last I climbed back down the ladder slipped into the water and stroked for shore as quietly as I could I was rested my head had stopped aching although the knot above the nape of my neck still throbbed steadily and I no longer felt offbalance and incredulous In some ways that had been the worst of it  trying to cope not just with the apparition of the drowned boy the flying rocks and the lake but with the pervasive sense that none of this could be happening that rich old software moguls did not try to drown novelists who strayed into their line of sight Had tonights adventure been a case of simple straying into Devores view though A coincidental meeting no more than that Wasnt it likely hed been having me watched ever since the Fourth of July    maybe from the other side of the lake by people with highpowered optical equipment Paranoid bullshit I would have said    at least I would have said it before the two of them almost sank me in Dark Score Lake like a kids paper boat in a mudpuddle I decided I didnt care who might be watching from the other side of the lake I didnt care if the two of them were still lurking on one of the treeshielded parts of The Street either I swam until I could feel strands of waterweed tickling my ankles and see the crescent of my beach Then I stood up wincing at the air which now felt cold on my skin I limped to shore one hand raised to fend off a hail of rocks but no rocks came I stood for a moment on The Street my jeans and polo shirt dripping looking first one way then the other It seemed I had this little part of the world to myself Last I looked back at the water where weak moonlight beat a track from the thumbnail of beach out to the swimming float Thanks Jo I said then started up the railroad ties to the house I got about halfway then had to stop and sit down I had never been so utterly tired in my whole life I climbed the stairs to the deck instead of going around to the front door still moving slowly and marvelling at how my legs felt twice their normal weight When I stepped into the living room I looked around with the wide eyes of someone who has been away for a decade and returns to find everything just as he left it Bunter the moose on the wall the Boston Globe on the couch a compilation of Tough Stuff crossword puzzles on the endtable the plate on the counter with the remains of my stirfry still on it Looking at these things brought the realization home full force  I had gone for a walk leaving all this normal light clutter behind and had almost died instead Had almost been murdered I began to shake I went into the northwing bathroom took off my wet clothes and threw them into the tub  splat Then still shaking I turned and stared at myself in the mirror over the washbasin I looked like someone who has been on the losing side in a barroom brawl One bicep bore a long clotting gash A blackishpurple bruise was unfurling what looked like shadowy wings on my left collarbone There was a bloody furrow on my neck and behind my ear where the lovely Rogette had caught me with the stone in her ring I took my shaving mirror and used it to check the back of my head Cant you get that through your thick skull my mother used to shout at me and Sid when we were kids and now I thanked God that Ma had apparently been right about the thickness factor at least in my case The spot where Devore had struck me with his cane looked like the cone of a recently extinct volcano Whitmores bullseye had left a red wound that would need stitches if I wanted to avoid a scar Blood rusty and thin stained the nape of my neck all around the hairline God knew how much had flowed out of that unpleasantlooking red mouth and been washed away by the lake I poured hydrogen peroxide into my cupped palm steeled myself and slapped it onto the gash back there like aftershave The bite was monstrous and I had to tighten my lips to keep from crying out When the pain started to fade a little I soaked cotton balls with more peroxide and cleaned my other wounds I showered threw on a teeshirt and a pair of jeans then went into the hall to phone the County Sheriff There was no need for directory assistance the Castle Rock PD and County Sheriffs numbers were on the IN CASE OF EMERGENCY card thumbtacked to the bulletin board along with numbers for the fire department the ambulance service and the number where you could get three answers to that days Times crossword puzzle for a buckfifty I dialed the first three numbers fast then began to slow down I got as far as  before stopping altogether I stood there in the hall with the phone pressed against my ear visualizing another headline this one not in the decorous Times but the rowdy New York Post NOVELIST TO AGING COMPUKING YOU BIG BULLY Along with sidebyside pictures of me looking roughly my age and Max Devore looking roughly a hundred and six The Post would have great fun telling its readers how Devore along with his companion an elderly lady who might weigh ninety pounds soaking wet had lumped up a novelist half his age  a guy who looked in his photograph at least reasonably trim and fit The phone got tired of holding only six of the required seven numbers in its rudimentary brain doubleclicked and dumped me back to an open line I took the handset away from my ear stared at it for a moment and then set it gently back down in its cradle Im not a sissy about the sometimes whimsical sometimes hateful attention of the press but Im wary as I would be around a badtempered furbearing mammal America has turned the people who entertain it into weird highclass whores and the media jeers at any celeb who dares complain about his or her treatment Quitcha bitchin cry the newspapers and the TV gossip shows the tone is one of mingled triumph and indignation Didja really think we paid ya the big bucks just to sing a song or swing a Louisville Slugger Wrong asshole We pay so we can be amazed when you do it well  whatever it happens to be in your particular case  and also because its gratifying when you fuck up The truth is youre supplies If you cease to be amusing we can always kill you and eat you They cant really eat you of course They can print pictures of you with your shirt off and say youre running to fat they can talk about how much you drink or how many pills you take or snicker about the night you pulled some starlet onto your lap at Spago and tried to stick your tongue in her ear but they cant really eat you So it wasnt the thought of the Post calling me a crybaby or being a part of Jay Lenos opening monologue that made me put the phone down it was the realization that I had no proof No one had seen us And I realized finding an alibi for himself and his personal assistant would be the easiest thing in the world for Max Devore There was one other thing too the capper imagining the County Sheriff sending out George Footman aka daddy to take my statement on how the mean man had knocked lil Mikey into the lake How the three of them would laugh later about that I called John Storrow instead wanting him to tell me I was doing the right thing the only thing that made any sense Wanting him to remind me that only desperate men were driven to such desperate lengths I would ignore at least for the time being how the two of them had laughed as if they were having the time of their lives and that nothing had changed in regard to Ki Devore  her grandfathers custody case still sucked bogwater I got Johns recording machine at home and left a message  just call Mike Noonan no emergency but feel free to call late Then I tried his office mindful of the scripture according to John Grisham young lawyers work until they drop I listened to the firms recording machine then followed instructions and punched STO on my phone keypad the first three letters of Johns last name There was a click and he came on the line  another recorded version unfortunately Hi this is John Storrow Ive gone up to Philly for the weekend to see my mom and dad Ill be in the office on Monday for the rest of the week Ill be out on business From Tuesday to Friday youll probably have the most luck trying to reach me at     The number he gave began  which meant Castle Rock I imagined it was the hotel where hed stayed before the nice one up on the View Mike Noonan I said Call me when you can I left a message on your apartment machine too I went in the kitchen to get a beer then only stood there in front of the refrigerator playing with the magnets Whoremaster hed called me Say there whoremaster wheres your whore A minute later he had offered to save my soul Quite funny really Like an alcoholic offering to take care of your liquor cabinet He spoke of you with what I think was genuine affection Mattie had said Your greatgrandfather and his greatgrandfather shit in the same pit I left the fridge with all the beer still safe inside went back to the phone and called Mattie Hi said another obviously recorded voice I was on a roll Its me but either Im out or not able to come to the phone right this minute Leave a message okay A pause the mike rustling a distant whisper and then Kyra so loud she almost blew my ear off Leave a HAPPY message What followed was laughter from both of them cut off by the beep Hi Mattie its Mike Noonan I said I just wanted   I dont know how I would have finished that thought and I didnt have to There was a click and then Mattie herself said Hello Mike There was such a difference between this dreary defeatedsounding voice and the cheerful one on the tape that for a moment I was silenced Then I asked her what was wrong Nothing she said then began to cry Everything I lost my job Lindy fired me Firing wasnt what Lindy had called it of course Shed called it belttightening but it was firing all right and I knew that if I looked into the funding of the Four Lakes Consolidated Library I would discover that one of the chief supporters over the years had been Mr Max Devore And hed continue to be one of the chief supporters    if that was Lindy Briggs played ball We shouldnt have talked where she could see us doing it I said knowing I could have stayed away from the library completely and Mattie would be just as gone And we probably should have seen this coming John Storrow did see it She was still crying but making an effort to get it under control He said Max Devore would probably want to make sure I was as deep in the corner as he could push me come the custody hearing He said Devore would want to make sure I answered Im unemployed Your Honor when the judge asked where I worked I told John Mrs Briggs would never do anything so low especially to a girl whod given such a brilliant talk on Melvilles Bartleby Do you know what he told me No He said Youre very young I thought that was a patronizing thing to say but he was right wasnt he Mattie   What am I going to do Mike What am I going to do The panicrat had moved on down to Wasp Hill Road it sounded like I thought quite coldly Why not become my mistress Your title will be research assistant a perfectly jake occupation as far as the IRS is concerned Ill throw in clothes a couple of charge cards a house  say goodbye to the rustbucket doublewide on Wasp Hill Road  and a twoweek vacation how does February on Maui sound Plus Kis education of course and a hefty cash bonus at the end of the year Ill be considerate too Considerate and discreet Once or twice a week and never until your little girl is fast asleep All you have to do is say yes and give me a key All you have to do is slide over when I slide in All you have to do is let me do what I want  all through the dark all through the night let me touch where I want to touch let me do what I want to do never say no never say stop I closed my eyes Mike Are you there Sure I said I touched the throbbing gash at the back of my head and winced Youre going to do just fine Mattie You   The trailers not paid for she nearly wailed I have two overdue phone bills and theyre threatening to cut off the service Theres something wrong with the Jeeps transmission and the rear axle as well I can pay for Kis last week of Vacation Bible School I guess  Mrs Briggs gave me three weeks pay in lieu of notice  but how will I buy her shoes She outgrows everything so fast    theres holes in all her shorts and most of her gggoddam underwear     She was starting to weep again Im going to take care of you until you get back on your feet I said No I cant let   You can And for Kyras sake you will Later on if you still want to you can pay me back Well keep tabs on every dollar and dime if you like But Im going to take care of you And youll never take off your clothes when Im with you Thats a promise and Im going to keep it Mike you dont have to do this Maybe maybe not But I am going to do it You just try and stop me Id called meaning to tell her what had happened to me  giving her the humorous version  but that now seemed like the worst idea in the world This custody thing is going to be over before you know it and if you cant find anyone brave enough to put you to work down here once it is Ill find someone up in Derry wholl do it Besides tell me the truth  arent you starting to feel that it might be time for a change of scenery She managed a scrap of a laugh I guess you could say that Heard from John today Actually yes Hes visiting his parents in Philadelphia but he gave me the number there I called him Hed said he was taken with her Perhaps she was taken with him as well I told myself the thorny little tug I felt across my emotions at the idea was only my imagination Tried to tell myself that anyway What did he say about you losing your job the way you did The same things you said But he didnt make me feel safe You do I dont know why I did I was an older man and that is our chief attraction to young women we make them feel safe Hes coming up again Tuesday morning I said Id have lunch with him Smoothly not a tremor or hesitation in my voice I said Maybe I could join you Matties own voice warmed at the suggestion her ready acceptance made me feel paradoxically guilty That would be great Why dont I call him and suggest that you both come over here I could barbecue again Maybe Ill keep Ki home from VBS and make it a foursome Shes hoping youll read her another story She really enjoyed that That sounds great I said and meant it Adding Kyra made it all seem more natural less of an intrusion on my part Also less like a date on theirs John could not be accused of taking an unethical interest in his client In the end hed probably thank me I believe Ki might be ready to move on to Hansel and Gretel How are you Mattie All right Much better than I was before you called Good Things are going to be all right Promise me I think I just did There was a slight pause Are you all right Mike You sound a little    I dont know    a little strange Im okay I said and I was for someone who had been pretty sure he was drowning less than an hour ago Can I ask you one question before I go Because this is driving me crazy Of course The night we had dinner you said Devore told you his greatgrandfather and mine knew each other Pretty well according to him He said they shit in the same pit I thought that was elegant Did he say anything else Think hard She did but came up with nothing I told her to call me if something about that conversation did occur to her or if she got lonely or scared or if she started to feel worried about anything I didnt like to say too much but I had already decided Id have to have a frank talk with John about my latest adventure It might be prudent to have the private detective from Lewiston George Kennedy like the actor  put a man or two on the TR to keep an eye on Mattie and Kyra Max Devore was mad just as my caretaker had said I hadnt understood then but I did now Any time I started to doubt all I had to do was touch the back of my head I returned to the fridge and once more forgot to open it My hands went to the magnets instead and again began moving them around watching as words formed broke apart evolved It was a peculiar kind of writing    but it was writing I could tell by the way I was starting to trance out That halfhypnotized stare is one you cultivate until you can switch it on and off at will    at least you can when things are going well The intuitive part of the mind unlocks itself when you begin work and rises to a height of about six feet maybe ten on good days Once there it simply hovers sending blackmagic messages and bright pictures For the balance of the day that part is locked to the rest of the machinery and goes pretty much forgotten    except on certain occasions when it comes loose on its own and you trance out unexpectedly your mind making associations which have nothing to do with rational thought and glaring with unexpected images That is in some ways the strangest part of the creative process The muses are ghosts and sometimes they come uninvited My house is haunted Sara Laughs has always been haunted    youve stirred em up stirred I wrote on the refrigerator But it didnt look right so I made a circle of fruit and vegetable magnets around it That was better much I stood there for a moment hands crossed over my chest as I crossed them at my desk when I was stuck for a word or a phrase then took off stirr and put on haunt making haunted Its haunted in the circle I said and barely heard the faint chime of Bunters bell as if in agreement I took the letters off and as I did found myself thinking how odd it was to have a lawyer named Romeo  romeo went in the circle  and a detective named George Kennedy george went up on the fridge I wondered if Kennedy could help me with Andy Drake  drake on the fridge  maybe give me some insights Id never written about a private detective before and its the little stuff  rake off leave the d add etails  that makes the difference I turned a  on its back and put an I beneath it making a pitchfork The devils in the details From there I went somewhere else I dont know where exactly because I was tranced out that intuitive part of my mind up so high a searchparty couldnt have found it I stood in front of my fridge and played with the letters spelling out little pieces of thought without even thinking about them You mightnt believe such a thing is possible but every writer knows it is What brought me back was light splashing across the windows of the foyer I looked up and saw the shape of a car pulling to a stop behind my Chevrolet A cramp of terror seized my belly That was a moment when I would have given everything I owned for a loaded gun Because it was Footman Had to be Devore had called him when he and Whitmore got back to Warringtons had told him Noonan refuses to be a good Martian so get over there and fix him When the drivers door opened and the domelight in the visitors car came on I breathed a conditional sigh of relief I didnt know who it was but it sure wasnt daddy This fellow didnt look as if he could take care of a housefly with a rolledup newspaper    although I supposed there were plenty of people who had made that same mistake about Jeffrey Dahmer Above the fridge was a cluster of aerosol cans all of them old and probably not ozonefriendly I didnt know how Mrs M had missed them but I was pleased she had I took the first one my hand touched  Black Flag excellent choice  thumbed off the cap and stuck the can in the left front pocket of my jeans Then I turned to the drawers on the right of the sink The top one contained silverware The second one held what Jo called kitchenshit  everything from poultry thermometers to those gadgets you stick in corncobs so you dont burn your fingers off The third one down held a generous selection of mismatched steak knives I took one put it in the right front pocket of my jeans and went to the door The man on my stoop jumped a little when I turned on the outside light then blinked through the door at me like a nearsighted rabbit He was about fivefour skinny pale He wore his hair cropped in the sort of cut known as a wiffle in my boyhood days His eyes were brown Guarding them was a pair of hornrimmed glasses with greasylooking lenses His little hands hung at his sides One held the handle of a flat leather case the other a small white oblong I didnt think it was my destiny to be killed by a man with a business card in one hand so I opened the door The guy smiled the anxious sort of smile people always seem to wear in Woody Allen movies He was wearing a Woody Allen outfit too I saw  faded plaid shirt a little too short at the wrists chinos a little too baggy in the crotch Someone must have told him about the resemblance I thought Thats got to be it Mr Noonan Yes He handed me the card NEXT CENTURY REAL ESTATE it said in raised gold letters Below this in more modest black was my visitors name Im Richard Osgood he said as if I couldnt read and held out his hand The American males need to respond to that gesture in kind is deeply ingrained but that night I resisted it He held his little pink paw out a moment longer then lowered it and wiped the palm nervously against his chinos I have a message for you From Mr Devore I waited May I come in No I said He took a step backward wiped his hand on his pants again and seemed to gather himself I hardly think theres any need to be rude Mr Noonan I wasnt being rude If Id wanted to be rude I would have treated him to a faceful of roachrepellent Max Devore and his minder tried to drown me in the lake this evening If my manners seem a little off to you thats probably it Osgoods look of shock was real I think You must be working too hard on your latest project Mr Noonan Max Devore is going to be eightysix on his next birthday  if he makes it which now seems to be in some doubt Poor old fella can hardly even walk from his chair to his bed anymore As for Rogette   I see your point I said In fact I saw it twenty minutes ago without any help from you I hardly believe it myself and I was there Give me whatever it is you have for me Fine he said in a prissy little all right be that way voice He unzipped a pouch on the front of his leather bag and brought out a white envelope businesssized and sealed I took it hoping Osgood couldnt sense how hard my heart was thumping Devore moved pretty damned fast for a man who travelled with an oxygen tank The question was what kind of move was this Thanks I said beginning to close the door Id tip you the price of a drink but I left my wallet on the dresser Wait Youre supposed to read it and give me an answer I raised my eyebrows I dont know where Devore got the notion that he could order me around but I have no intention of allowing his ideas to influence my behavior Buzz off His lips turned down creating deep dimples at the corners of his mouth and all at once he didnt look like Woody Allen at all He looked like a fiftyyearold realestate broker who had sold his soul to the devil and now couldnt stand to see anyone yank the bosss forked tail Piece of friendly advice Mr Noonan  you want to watch it Max Devore is no man to fool around with Luckily for me Im not fooling around I closed the door and stood in the foyer holding the envelope and watching Mr Next Century Real Estate He looked pissed off and confused  no one had given him the bums rush just lately I guessed Maybe it would do him some good Lend a little perspective to his life Remind him that Max Devore or no Max Devore Richie Osgood would still never stand more than fivefeetseven Even in cowboy boots Mr Devore wants an answer he called through the closed door Ill phone I called back then slowly raised my middle fingers in the double eagle Id hoped to give Max and Rogette earlier In the meantime perhaps you could convey this I almost expected him to take off his glasses and rub his eyes He walked back to his car instead tossed his case in then followed it I watched until he had backed up to the lane and I was sure he was gone Then I went into the living room and opened the envelope Inside was a single sheet of paper faintly scented with the perfume my mother had worn when I was just a kid White Shoulders I think its called Across the top  neat ladylike printed in slightly raised letters  was ROGETTE D WHITMORE Below it was this message written in a slightly shaky feminine hand  PM Dear Mr Noonan Max wishes me to convey how glad he was to meet you I must echo that sentiment You are a very amusing and entertaining fellow We enjoyed your antics ever so much Now to business M offers you a very simple deal if you promise to cease asking questions about him and if you promise to cease all legal maneuvering  if you promise to let him rest in peace so to speak then Mr Devore promises to cease efforts to gain custody of his granddaughter If this suits you need only tell Mr Osgood I agree He will carry the message Max hopes to return to California by private jet very soon  he has business which can be put off no longer although he has enjoyed his time here and has found you particularly interesting He wants me to remind you that custody has its responsibilities and urges you not to forget he said so Rogette PS He reminds me that you didnt answer his question  does her cunt suck Max is quite curious on that point R I read this note over a second time then a third I started to put it on the table then read it a fourth time It was as if I couldnt get the sense of it I had to restrain an urge to fly to the telephone and call Mattie at once Its over Mattie Id say Taking your job and dunking me in the lake were the last two shots of the war Hes giving up No Not until I was absolutely sure I called Warringtons instead where I got my fourth answering machine of the night Devore and Whitmore hadnt bothered with anything warm and fuzzy either a voice as cold as a motel icemachine simply told me to leave my message at the sound of the beep Its Noonan I said Before I could go any further there was a click as someone picked up Did you enjoy your swim Rogette Whitmore asked in a smoky mocking voice if I hadnt seen her in the flesh I might have imagined a Barbara Stanwyck type at her most coldly attractive coiled on a red velvet couch in a peachsilk dressing gown telephone in one hand ivory cigarette holder in the other If Id caught up with you Ms Whitmore I would have made you understand my feelings perfectly Oooo she said My thighs are atingle Please spare me the image of your thighs Sticks and stones Mr Noonan she said To what do we owe the pleasure of your call I sent Mr Osgood away without a reply Max thought you might He said Our young whoremaster believes in the value of a personal response You can tell that just looking at him He gets the uglies when he loses doesnt he Mr Devore doesnt lose Her voice dropped at least forty degrees and all the mocking good humor bailed out on the way down He may change his goals but he doesnt lose You were the one who looked like a loser tonight Mr Noonan paddling around and yelling out there in the lake You were scared werent you Yes Badly You were right to be I wonder if you know how lucky you are May I tell you something Of course Mike  may I call you Mike Why dont you just stick with Mr Noonan Now  are you listening With bated breath Your boss is old hes nutty and I suspect hes past the point where he could effectively manage a Yahtzee scorecard let alone a custody suit He was whipped a week ago Do you have a point As a matter of fact I do so get it right if either of you ever tries anything remotely like that again Ill come after that old fuck and jam his snotsmeared oxygen mask so far up his ass hell be able to aerate his lungs from the bottom And if I see you on The Street Ms Whitmore Ill use you for a shotput Do you understand me I stopped breathing hard amazed and also rather disgusted with myself If you had told me Id had such a speech in me I would have scoffed After a long silence I said Ms Whitmore Still there Im here she said I wanted her to be furious but she actually sounded amused Who has the uglies now Mr Noonan I do I said and dont you forget it you rockthrowing bitch What is your answer to Mr Devore We have a deal I shut up the lawyers shut up he gets out of Mattie and Kyras life If on the other hand he continues to   I know I know youll bore him and stroke him I wonder how youll feel about all this a week from now you arrogant stupid creature Before I could reply  it was on the tip of my tongue to tell her that even at her best she still threw like a girl  she was gone I stood there with the telephone in my hand for a few seconds then hung it up Was it a trick It felt like a trick but at the same time it didnt John needed to know about this He hadnt left his parents number on his answering machine but Mattie had it If I called her back though Id be obligated to tell her what had just happened It might be a good idea to put off any further calls until tomorrow To sleep on it I stuck my hand in my pocket and damned near impaled it on the steak knife hiding there Id forgotten all about it I took it out carried it back into the kitchen and returned it to the drawer Next I fished out the aerosol can turned to put it back on top of the fridge with its elderly brothers then stopped Inside the circle of fruit and vegetable magnets was this d go w n Had I done that myself Had I been so far into the zone so tranced out that I had put a minicrossword on the refrigerator without remembering it And if so what did it mean Maybe someone else put it up I thought One of my invisible roommates Go down n I said reaching out and touching the letters A compass heading Or maybe it meant Go  Down That suggested crosswords again Sometimes in a puzzle you get a clue which reads simply See  Across or See  Down If that was the meaning here what puzzle was I supposed to check I could use a little help here I said but there was no answer  not from the astral plane not from inside my own head I finally got the can of beer Id been promising myself and took it back to the sofa I picked up my Tough Stuff crossword book and looked at the puzzle I was currently working Liquor Is Quicker it was called and it was filled with the stupid puns which only crossword addicts find amusing Tipsy actor Marion Brandy Tipsy southern novel Tequila Mockingbird Drives the DA to drink Bourbon of proof And the definition of Down was Oriental nurse which every cruciverbalist in the universe knows is amah Nothing in Liquor Is Quicker connected to what was going on in my life at least that I could see I thumbed through some of the other puzzles in the book looking at  Downs Marble workers tool chisel CNNs favorite howler  wds wolfblitzer Ethanol and dimethyl ether eg isomers I tossed the book aside in disgust Who said it had to be this particular crossword collection anyway There were probably fifty others in the house four or five in the drawer of the very endtable on which my beer can stood I leaned back on the sofa and closed my eyes I always liked a whore    sometimes their place was on my face This is where good pups and vile dogs may walk sidebyside Theres no town drunk here we all take turns This is where it happened Ayuh I fell asleep and woke up three hours later with a stiff neck and a terrible throb in the back of my head Thunder was rumbling thickly far off in the White Mountains and the house seemed very hot When I got up from the couch the backs of my thighs more or less peeled away from the fabric I shuffled down to the north wing like an old old man looked at my wet clothes thought about taking them into the laundry room and then decided if I bent over that far my head might explode You ghosts take care of it I muttered If you can change the pants and the underwear around on the whirligig you can put my clothes in the hamper I took three Tylenol and went to bed At some point I woke a second time and heard the phantom child sobbing Stop I told it Stop it Ki no ones going to take you anywhere Youre safe Then I went back to sleep again The telephone was ringing I climbed toward it from a drowning dream where I couldnt catch my breath rising into early sunlight wincing at the pain in the back of my head as I swung my feet out of bed The phone would quit before I got to it they almost always do in such situations and then Id lie back down and spend a fruitless ten minutes wondering who it had been before getting up for good Ringgg   ringgg    ringgg    Was that ten A dozen Id lost count Someone was really dedicated I hoped it wasnt trouble but in my experience people dont try that hard when the news is good I touched my fingers gingerly to the back of my head It hurt plenty but that deep sick ache seemed to be gone And there was no blood on my fingers when I looked at them I padded down the hall and picked up the phone Hello Well you wont have to worry about testifyin at the kids custody hearin anymore at least Bill Ayuh How did you know     I leaned around the corner and peered at the waggy annoying catclock Twenty minutes past seven and already sweltering Hottern a bugger as us TR Martians like to say How do you know he decided   I dont know nothing about his business one way or tother Bill sounded touchy He never called to ask my advice and I never called to give him any Whats happened Whats going on You havent had the TV on yet I dont even have the coffee on yet No apology from Bill he was a fellow who believed that people who didnt get up until after six AM deserved whatever they got I was awake now though And had a pretty good idea of what was coming Devore killed himself last night Mike Got into a tub of warm water and pulled a plastic bag over his head Mustnt have taken long with his lungs the way they were No I thought probably not long In spite of the humid summer heat that already lay on the house I shivered Who found him The woman Ayuh sure What time Shortly before midnight they said on the Channel  news Right around the time I had awakened on the couch and taken myself stiffly off to bed in other words Is she implicated Did she play Kevorkian you mean The news report I saw didnt say nothin about that The gossipmill down to the Lakeview General will be turnin brisk by now but I aint been down yet for my share of the grain If she helped him I dont think shell ever see trouble for it do you He was eightyfive and not well Do you know if hell be buried on the TR California She said thered be services in Palm Springs on Tuesday A sense of surpassing oddness swept over me as I realized the source of Matties problems might be lying in a chapel filled with flowers at the same time The Friends of Kyra Devore were digesting their lunches and getting ready to start throwing the Frisbee around Its going to be a celebration I thought wonderingly I dont know how theyre going to handle it in The Little Chapel of the Microchips in Palm Springs but on Wasp Hill Road theyre going to be dancing and throwing their arms in the sky and hollering Yes lawd Id never been glad to hear of anyones death before in my life but I was glad to hear of Devores I was sorry to feel that way but I did The old bastard had dumped me in the lake    but before the night was over he was the one who had drowned Inside a plastic bag he had drowned sitting in a tub of tepid water Any idea how the TV guys got onto it so fast It wasnt superfast not with seven hours between the discovery of the body and the seven oclock news but TV news people have a tendency to be lazy Whitmore called em Had a press conference right there in Warringtons parlor at two oclock this morning Took questions settin on that big maroon plush sofa the one Jo always used to say should be in a saloon oil paintin with a naked woman lyin on it Remember Yeah I saw a coupla County deputies walkin around in the background plus a fella I reckonized from Jaquards Funeral Home in Motton Thats bizarre I said Ayuh body still upstairs most likely while Whitmore was runnin her gums    but she claimed she was just followin the bosss orders Said he left a tape sayin hed done it on Friday night so as not to affect the cumpny stock price and wanted Rogette to call in the press right off and assure folks that the cumpny was solid that between his son and the Board of Directors everythin was going to be just aceydeucey Then she told about the services in Palm Springs He commits suicide then holds a two AM press conference by proxy to soothe the stockholders Ayuh And it sounds just like him A silence fell between us on the line I tried to think and couldnt All I knew was that I wanted to go upstairs and work aching head or no aching head I wanted to rejoin Andy Drake John Shackleford and Shacklefords childhood friend the awful Ray Garraty There was madness in my story but it was a madness I understood Bill I said at last are we still friends Christ yes he said promptly But if theres people around who seem a little standoffy to you youll know why wont you Sure Id know Many would blame the old mans death on me It was crazy given his physical condition and it would by no means be a majority opinion but the idea would gain a certain amount of credence at least in the short run  I knew that as well as I knew the truth about John Shacklefords childhood friend Kiddies once upon a time there was a goose that flew back to the little unincorporated township where it had lived as a downy gosling It began laying lovely golden eggs and the townsfolk all gathered around to marvel and receive their share Now however that goose was cooked and someone had to take the heat Id get some but Matties kitchen might get a few degrees toastier than mine shed had the temerity to fight for her child instead of silently handing Ki over Keep your head down the next few weeks Bill said Thatd be my idea In fact if you had business that took you right out of the TR until all this settles down that might be for the best I appreciate the sense of what youre saying but I cant Im writing a book If I pick up my shit and move its apt to die on me Its happened before and I dont want it to happen this time Pretty good yarn is it Not bad but thats not the important thing Its    well lets just say this ones important to me for other reasons Wouldnt it travel as far as Derry Are you trying to get rid of me William Im tryin to keep an eye out thats all  caretakins my job yknow And dont say you werent warned the hives gonna buzz Theres two stories going around about you Mike One is that youre shacking with Mattie Devore The other is that you came back to write a hatchetjob on the TR Pull out all the old skeletons you can find Finish what Jo started in other words Whos been spreading that story Bill Silence from Bill We were back on earthquake ground again and this time that ground felt shakier than ever The book Im working on is a novel I said Set in Florida Oh ayuh You wouldnt think three little syllables could have so much relief in them Think you could kind of pass that around I think I could he said If you tell Brenda Meserve itd get around even faster and go even farther Okay I will As far as Mattie goes   Mike you dont have to Im not shacking with her That was never the deal The deal was like walking down the street turning the corner and seeing a big guy beating up a little guy I paused She and her lawyer are planning a barbecue at her place Tuesday noon Im planning to join them Are people from town going to think were dancing on Devores grave Some will Royce Merrill will Dickie Brooks will Old ladies in pants Yvette calls em Well fuck them I said Every last one I understand how you feel but tell her not to shove it in folks faces he almost pleaded Do that much Mike It wouldnt kill her to drag her grill around back of her trailer would it At least with it there folks lookin out from the store or the garage wouldnt see nothing but the smoke Ill pass on the message And if I make the party Ill put the barbecue around back myself Youd do well to stay away from that girl and her child Bill said You can tell me its none of my business but Im talkin to you like a Dutch uncle tellin you for your own good I had a flash of my dream then The slick exquisite tightness as I slipped inside her The little breasts with their hard nipples Her voice in the darkness telling me to do what I wanted My body responded almost instantly I know you are I said All right He sounded relieved that I wasnt going to scold him  take him to school he would have said Ill let you go n have your breakfast I appreciate you calling Almost didnt Yvette talked me into it She said You always liked Mike and Jo Noonan best of all the ones you did for Dont you get in bad with him now that hes back home Tell her I appreciate it I said I hung up the phone and looked at it thoughtfully We seemed to be on good terms again    but I didnt think we were exactly friends Certainly not the way we had been That had changed when I realized Bill was lying to me about some things and holding back about others it had also changed when I realized what he had almost called Sara and the RedTops You cant condemn a manor what may only be a figment of your own imagination True and Id try not to do it    but I knew what I knew I went into the living room snapped on the TV then snapped it off again My satellite dish got fifty or sixty different channels and not a one of them local There was a portable TV in the kitchen however and if I dipped its rabbitears toward the lake Id be able to get WMTW the ABC affiliate in western Maine I snatched up Rogettes note went into the kitchen and turned on the little Sony tucked under the cabinets with the coffeemaker Good Morning America was on but they would be breaking for the local news soon In the meantime I scanned the note this time concentrating on the mode of expression rather than the message which had taken all of my attention the night before Hopes to return to California by private jet very soon she had written Has business which can be put off no longer she had written If you promise to let him rest in peace she had written It was a goddam suicide note You knew I said rubbing my thumb over the raised letters of her name You knew when you wrote this and probably when you were chucking rocks at me But why Custody has its responsibilities she had written Dont forget he said so But the custody business was over right Not even a judge that was bought and paid for could award custody to a dead man GMA finally gave way to the local report where Max Devores suicide was the leader The TV picture was snowy but I could see the maroon sofa Bill had mentioned and Rogette Whitmore sitting on it with her hands folded composedly in her lap I thought one of the deputies in the background was George Footman although the snow was too heavy for me to be completely sure Mr Devore had spoken frequently over the last eight months of ending his life Whitmore said He had been very unwell He had asked her to come out with him the previous evening and she realized now that he had wanted to look at one final sunset It had been a glorious one too she added I could have corroborated that I remembered the sunset very well having almost drowned by its light Rogette was reading Devores statement when my phone rang again It was Mattie and she was crying in hard gusts The news she said Mike did you see    do you know     At first that was all she could manage that was coherent I told her I did know Bill Dean had called me and then Id caught some of it on the local news She tried to reply and couldnt speak Guilt relief horror even hilarity  I heard all those things in her crying I asked where Ki was I could sympathize with how Mattie felt  until turning on the news this morning shed believed old Max Devore was her bitterest enemy  but I didnt like the idea of a threeyearold girl watching her mom fall apart Out back she managed Shes had her breakfast Now shes having a ddoll ppp    doll pippic   Doll picnic Yes Good Let it go then All of it Let it out She cried for two minutes at least maybe longer I stood with the telephone pressed to my ear sweating in the July heat trying to be patient Im going to give you one chance to save your soul Devore had told me but this morning he was dead and his soul was wherever it was He was dead Mattie was free I was writing Life should have felt wonderful but it didnt At last she began to get her control back Im sorry I havent cried like that  really really cried  since Lance died Its understandable and youre allowed Come to lunch she said Come to lunch please Mike Kis going to spend the afternoon with a friend she met at Vacation Bible School and we can talk I need to talk to someone    God my head is spinning Please say youll come Id love to but its a bad idea Especially with Ki gone I gave her an edited version of my conversation with Bill Dean She listened carefully I thought there might be an angry outburst when I finished but Id forgotten one simple fact Mattie Stanchfield Devore had lived around here all her life She knew how things worked I understand that things will heal quicker if I keep my eyes down my mouth shut and my knees together she said and Ill do my best to go along but diplomacy only stretches so far That old man was trying to take my daughter away dont they realize that down at the goddam general store I realize it I know Thats why I wanted to talk to you What if we had an early supper on the Castle Rock common Same place as Friday Say fiveish Id have to bring Ki   Fine I said Bring her Tell her I know Hansel and Gretel by heart and am willing to share Will you call John in Philly Give him the details Yes Ill wait another hour or so God Im so happy I know thats wrong but Im so happy I could burst That makes two of us There was a pause on the other end I heard a long watery intake of breath Mattie All right Yes but how do you tell a threeyearold her grandfather died Tell her the old fuck slipped and fell headfirst into a Glad Bag I thought then pressed the back of my hand against my mouth to stifle a spate of lunatic cackles I dont know but youll have to do it as soon as she comes in I will Why Because shes going to see you Shes going to see your face I lasted exactly two hours in the upstairs study and then the heat drove me out  the thermometer on the stoop read ninetyfive degrees at ten oclock I guessed it might be five degrees warmer on the second floor Hoping I wasnt making a mistake I unplugged the IBM and carried it downstairs I was working without a shirt and as I crossed the living room the back of the typewriter slipped in the sweat coating my midriff and I almost dropped the outdated sonofabitch on my toes That made me think of my ankle the one Id hurt when I fell into the lake and I set the typewriter aside to look at it It was colorful black and purple and reddish at the edges but not terribly inflated I guessed my immersion in the cool water had helped keep the swelling down I put the typewriter on the deck table rummaged out an extension cord plugged in beneath Bunters watchful eye and sat down facing the hazy bluegray surface of the lake I waited for one of my old anxiety attacks to hit  the clenched stomach the throbbing eyes and worst of all that sensation of invisible steel bands clamped around my chest making it impossible to breathe Nothing like that happened The words flowed as easily down here as they had upstairs and my naked upper body was loving the little breeze that puffed in off the lake every now and again I forgot about Max Devore Mattie Devore Kyra Devore I forgot about Jo Noonan and Sara Tidwell I forgot about myself For two hours I was back in Florida John Shacklefords execution was nearing Andy Drake was racing the clock It was the telephone that brought me back and for once I didnt resent interruption If undisturbed I might have gone on writing until I simply melted into a sweaty pile of goo on the deck It was my brother We talked about Mom  in Siddys opinion she was now short an entire roof instead of just a few shingles  and her sister Francine who had broken her hip in June Sid wanted to know how I was doing and I told him I was doing all right Id had some problems getting going on a new book but now seemed to be back on track in my family the only permissible time to discuss trouble is when its over And how was the Sidster Kickin he said which I assumed meant just fine  Siddy has a twelveyearold and consequently his slang is always uptodate The new accounting business was starting to take hold although hed been scared for awhile first I knew of it of course He could never thank me enough for the bridge loan Id made him last November I replied that it was the least I could do which was the absolute truth especially when I considered how much more time  both in person and on the phone  he spent with our mother than I did Well Ill let you go Siddy told me after a few more pleasantries  he never says goodbye or so long when hes on the phone its always well Ill let you go as if hes been holding you hostage You want to keep cool up there Mike  Weather Channel says its going to be hotter than hell in New England all weekend Theres always the lake if things get too bad Hey Sid Hey what Like Ill let you go Hey what went back to childhood It was sort of comforting it was also sort of spooky Our folks all came from Prouts Neck right I mean on Daddys side Mom came from another world entirely  one where the men wear Lacoste polo shirts the women always wear full slips under their dresses and everyone knows the second verse of Dixie by heart She had met my dad in Portland while competing in a college cheerleading event Materfamilias came from Memphis quality darling and didnt let you forget it I guess so he said Yeah But dont go asking me a lot of familytree questions Mike  Im still not sure what the difference is between a nephew and a cousin and I told Jo the same thing Did you Everything inside me had gone very still    but I cant say I was surprised Not by then Uhhuh you bet What did she want to know Everything I knew Which isnt much I could have told her all about Mas greatgreatgrandfather the one who got killed by the Indians but Jo didnt seem to care about any of Mas folks When would this have been Does it matter It might Okay lets see I think it was around the time Patrick had his appendectomy Yeah Im sure it was February of  It might have been March but Im pretty sure it was February Six months from the Rite Aid parking lot Jo moving into the shadow of her own death like a woman stepping beneath the shade of an awning Not pregnant though not yet Jo making daytrips to the TR Jo asking questions some of the sort that made people feel bad according to Bill Dean    but shed gone on asking just the same Yeah Because once she got onto something Jo was like a terrier with a rag in its jaws Had she been asking questions of the man in the brown sportcoat Who was the man in the brown sportcoat Pat was in the hospital sure Dr Alpert said he was doing fine but when the phone rang I jumped for it  I halfexpected it to be him Alpert saying Pat had had a relapse or something Where in Gods name did you get this sense of impending doom Sid I dunno buddy but its there Anyway its not Alpert its Johanna She wants to know if we had any ancestors  three maybe even four generations back who lived there where you are or in one of the surrounding towns I told her I didnt know but you might Know I mean She said she didnt want to ask you because it was a surprise Was it a surprise A big one I said Daddy was a lobsterman   Bite your tongue he was an artist  a seacoast primitive Ma still calls him that Siddy wasnt quite laughing Shit he sold lobsterpot coffeetables and lawnpuffins to the tourists when he got too rheumatic to go out on the bay and haul traps I know that but Mas got her marriage edited like a movie for television How true Our own version of Blanche Du Bois Dad was a lobsterman in Prouts Neck He   Siddy interrupted singing the first verse of Papa Was a Rollin Stone in a horrible off key tenor Come on this is serious He had his first boat from his father right Thats the story Sid agreed Jack Noonans Lazy Betty original owner Paul Noonan Also of Prouts Boat took a hell of a pasting in Hurricane Donna back in  I think it was Donna Two years after I was born And Daddy put it up for sale in  Yep I dont know whatever became of it but it was Grampy Pauls to begin with all right Do you remember all the lobster stew we ate when we were kids Mikey Seacoast meatloaf I said hardly thinking about it Like most kids raised on the coast of Maine I cant imagine ordering lobster in a restaurant  thats for flatlanders I was thinking about Grampy Paul who had been born in the s Paul Noonan begat Jack Noonan Jack Noonan begat Mike and Sid Noonan and that was really all I knew except the Noonans had all grown up a long way from where I now stood sweating my brains out They shit in the same pit Devore had gotten it wrong that was all  when we Noonans werent wearing polo shirts and being Memphis quality we were Prouts Neckers It was unlikely that Devores greatgrandfather and my own would have had anything to do with each other in any case the old rip had been twice my age and that meant the generations didnt match up But if he had been totally wrong what had Jo been on about Mike Sid asked Are you there Yeah Are you okay You dont sound so great I have to tell you Its the heat I said Not to mention your sense of impending doom Thanks for calling Siddy Thanks for being there brother Kickin I said I went out to the kitchen to get a glass of cold water As I was filling it I heard the magnets on the fridge begin sliding around I whirled spilling some of the water on my bare feet and hardly noticing I was as excited as a kid who thinks he may glimpse Santa Claus before he shoots back up the chimney I was barely in time to see nine plastic letters drawn into the circle from all points of the compass CARLADEAN they spelled    but only for a second Some presence tremendous but unseen shot past me Not a hair on my head stirred but there was still a strong sense of being buffeted the way youre buffeted by the air of a passing express train if youre standing near the platform yellowline when the train bolts through I cried out in surprise and groped my glass of water back onto the counter spilling it I no longer felt in need of cold water because the temperature in the kitchen of Sara Laughs had dropped off the table I blew out my breath and saw vapor as you do on a cold day in January One puff maybe two and it was gone  but it had been there all right and for perhaps five seconds the film of sweat on my body turned to what felt like a slime of ice CARLADEAN exploded outward in all directions  it was like watching an atom being smashed in a cartoon Magnetized letters fruits and vegetables flew off the front of the refrigerator and scattered across the kitchen For a moment the fury which fuelled that scattering was something I could almost taste like gunpowder And something gave way before it going with a sighing rueful whisper I had heard before Oh Mike Oh Mike It was the voice Id caught on the MemoScriber tape and although I hadnt been sure then I was now  it was Jos voice But who was the other one Why had it scattered the letters Carla Dean Not Bills wife that was Yvette His mother His grandmother I walked slowly through the kitchen collecting fridgemagnets like prizes in a scavenger hunt and sticking them back on the Kenmore by the handful Nothing snatched them out of my hands nothing froze the sweat on the back of my neck Bunters bell didnt ring Still I wasnt alone and I knew it CARLADEAN Jo had wanted me to know Something else hadnt Something else had shot past me like the Wabash Cannonball trying to scatter the letters before I could read them Jo was here a boy who wept in the night was here too And what else What else was sharing my house with me I didnt see them at first which wasnt surprising it seemed that half of Castle Rock was on the town common as that sultry Saturday afternoon edged on toward evening The air was bright with hazy midsummer light and in it kids swarmed over the playground equipment a number of old men in bright red vests some sort of club I assumed  played chess and a group of young people lay on the grass listening to a teenager in a headband playing the guitar and singing one I remembered from an old Ian and Sylvia record a cheery tune that went Ella Speed was havin her lovin fun John Martin shot Ella with a Colt fortyone     I saw no joggers and no dogs chasing Frisbees It was just too goddam hot I was turning to look at the bandshell where an eightman combo called The Castle Rockers was setting up I had an idea In the Mood was about as close as they got to rock and roll when a small person hit me from behind grabbing me just above the knees and almost dumping me on the grass Gotcha the small person cried gleefully Kyra Devore Mattie called sounding both amused and irritated Youll knock him down I turned dropped the greasespotted McDonalds bag I had been carrying and lifted the kid up It felt natural and it felt wonderful You dont realize the weight of a healthy child until you hold one nor do you fully comprehend the life that runs through them like a bright wire I didnt get choked up Dont go all corny on me Mike Siddy would sometimes whisper when we were kids at the movies and I got weteyed at a sad part but I thought of Jo yes And the child she had been carrying when she fell down in that stupid parking lot yes to that too Ki was squealing and laughing her arms outspread and her hair hanging down in two amusing clumps accented by Raggedy Ann and Andy barrettes Dont tackle your own quarterback I yelled grinning and to my delight she yelled it right back at me Dont taggle yer own quartermack Dont taggle yer own quartermack I set her on her feet both of us laughing Ki took a step backward tripped herself and sat down on the grass laughing harder than ever I had a mean thought then brief but oh so clear if only the old lizard could see how much he was missed How sad we were at his passing Mattie walked over and tonight she looked as Id halfimagined her when I first met her  like one of those lovely children of privilege you see at the country club either goofing with their friends or sitting seriously at dinner with their parents She was in a white sleeveless dress and low heels her hair falling loose around her shoulders a touch of lipstick on her mouth Her eyes had a brilliance in them that hadnt been there before When she hugged me I could smell her perfume and feel the press of her firm little breasts I kissed her cheek she kissed me high up on the jaw making a smack in my ear that I felt all the way down my back Say things are going to be better now she whispered still holding me Lots better now I said and she hugged me again tight Then she stepped away You better have brought plenty food big boy because we plenty hungry womens Right Kyra I taggled my own quartermack Ki said then leaned back on her elbows giggling deliciously at the bright and hazy sky Come on I said and grabbed her by the middle I toted her that way to a nearby picnic table Ki kicking her legs and waving her arms and laughing I set her down on the bench she slid off it and beneath the table boneless as an eel and still laughing All right Kyra Elizabeth Mattie said Sit up and show the other side Good girl good girl she said clambering up beside me Thats the other side to me Mike Im sure I said Inside the bag there were Big Macs and fries for Mattie and me For Ki there was a colorful box upon which Ronald McDonald and his unindicted coconspirators capered Mattie I got a Happy Meal Mike got me a Happy Meal They have toys Well see what yours is Kyra opened the box poked around then smiled It lit up her whole face She brought out something that I at first thought was a big dustball For one horrible second I was back in my dream the one of Jo under the bed with the book over her face Give me that she had snarled Its my dustcatcher And something else too  some other association perhaps from some other dream I couldnt get hold of it Mike Mattie asked Curiosity in her voice and maybe borderline concern Its a doggy Ki said I won a doggy in my Happy Meal Yes of course A dog A little stuffed dog And it was gray not black    although why Id care about the color either way I didnt know Thats a pretty good prize I said taking it It was soft which was good and it was gray which was better Being gray made it all right somehow Crazy but true I handed it back to her and smiled Whats his name Ki asked jumping the little dog back and forth across her Happy Meal box What doggys name Mike And without thinking I said Strickland I thought shed look puzzled but she didnt She looked delighted Stricken she said bouncing the dog back and forth in everhigher leaps over the box Stricken Stricken My dog Stricken Whos this guy Strickland Mattie asked smiling a little She had begun to unwrap her hamburger A character in a book I read once I said watching Ki play with the little puffball dog No one real My grampa died she said five minutes later We were still at the picnic table but the food was mostly gone Strickland the stuffed puffball had been set to guard the remaining french fries I had been scanning the ebb and flow of people wondering who was here from the TR observing our tryst and simply burning to carry the news back home I saw no one I knew but that didnt mean a whole tot considering how long Id been away from this part of the world Mattie put down her burger and looked at Ki with some anxiety but I thought the kid was okay  she had been giving news not expressing grief I know he did I said Grampa was awful old Ki pinched a couple of french fries between her pudgy little fingers They rose to her mouth then gloop all gone Hes with Lord Jesus now We had all about Lord Jesus in VBS Yes Ki I thought right now Grampys probably teaching Lord Jesus how to use Pixel Easel and asking if there might be a whore handy Lord Jesus walked on water and also changed the wine into macaroni Yes something like that I said Its sad when people die isnt it It would be sad if Mattie died and it would be sad if you died but Grampy was old She said it as though I hadnt quite grasped this concept the first time In heaven hell get all fixed up Thats a good way to look at it hon I said Mattie did maintenance on Kis drooping barrettes working carefully and with a kind of absent love I thought she glowed in the summer light her skin in smooth tanned contrast to the white dress she had probably bought at one of the discount stores and I understood that I loved her Maybe that was all right I miss the white nana though Ki said and this time she did look sad She picked up the stuffed dog tried to feed him a french fry then put him down again Her small pretty face looked pensive now and I could see a whisper of her grandfather in it It was far back but it was there perceptible another ghost Mom says white nana went back to California with Grampys early remains Earthly remains Kibird Mattie said That means his body Will white nana come back and see me Mike I dont know We had a game It was all rhymes She looked more pensive than ever Your mom told me about that game I said She wont be back Ki said answering her own question One very large tear rolled down her right cheek She picked up Stricken stood him on his back legs for a second then put him back on guardduty Mattie slipped an arm around her but Ki didnt seem to notice White nana didnt really like me She was just pretending to like me That was her job Mattie and I exchanged a glance What makes you say that I asked Dont know Ki said Over by where the kid was playing the guitar a juggler in whiteface had started up working with half a dozen colored balls Kyra brightened a little Mommybommy may I go watch that funny white man Are you done eating Yeah Im full Thank Mike Dont taggle yer own quartermack she said then laughed kindly to show she was just pulling my leg Thanks Mike Not a problem I said and then because that sounded a little oldfashioned Kickin You can go as far as that tree but no farther Mattie said And you know why So you can see me I will She grabbed Strickland and started to run off then stopped and looked over her shoulder at me I guess it was the fridgeafator people she said then corrected herself very carefully and seriously The ree fridgearator people My heart took a hard double beat in my chest It was the refrigerator people what Ki I asked That said white nana didnt really like me Then she ran off toward the juggler oblivious to the heat Mattie watched her go then turned back to me I havent talked to anybody about Kis fridgeafator people Neither has she until now Not that there are any real people but the letters seem to move around by themselves Its like a Ouija board Do they spell things For a long time she said nothing Then she nodded Not always but sometimes Another pause Most times actually Ki calls it mail from the people in the refrigerator She smiled but her eyes were a little scared Are they special magnetic letters do you think Or have we got a poltergeist working the lakefront I dont know Im sorry I brought them if theyre a problem Dont be silly You gave them to her and youre a tremendously big deal to her right now She talks about you all the time She was much more interested in picking out something pretty to wear for you tonight than she was in her grandfathers death I was supposed to wear something pretty too Kyra insisted Shes not that way about people usually  she takes them when theyre there and leaves them when theyre gone Thats not such a bad way for a little girl to grow up I sometimes think You both dressed pretty I said That much Im sure of Thanks She looked fondly at Ki who stood by the tree watching the juggler He had put his rubber balls aside and moved on to Indian clubs Then she looked back at me Are we done eating I nodded and Mattie began to pick up the trash and stuff it back into the takeout bag I helped and when our fingers touched she gripped my hand and squeezed Thank you she said For everything youve done Thank you so damn much I squeezed back then let go You know she said its crossed my mind that Kyras moving the letters around herself Mentally Telekinesis I guess thats the technical term Only Ki cant spell much more than dog and cat Whats showing up on the fridge Names mostly Once it was yours Once it was your wifes Jo The whole thing  JOANNA And NANA Rogette I presume JARED shows up sometimes and BRIDGET Once there was KITO She spelled it Kito I said and thought Kyra Kia Kito What is this A boys name do you think I know it is Its Swahili and means precious child I looked it up in my babyname book She glanced toward her own precious child as we walked across the grass to the nearest trash barrel Any others that you can remember She thought REG has showed up a couple of times And once there was CARLA You understand that Ki cant even read these names as a rule dont you She has to ask me what they say Has it occurred to you that Kyra might be copying them out of a book or a magazine That shes learning to write using the magnetic letters on the fridge instead of paper and pencil I suppose thats possible     She didnt look as if she believed it though Not surprising I didnt believe it myself I mean youve never actually seen the letters moving around by themselves on the front of the fridge have you I hoped I sounded as unconcerned asking this question as I wanted to She laughed a bit nervously God no Anything else Sometimes the fridgeafator people leave messages like HI and BYE and GOOD GIRL There was one yesterday that I wrote down to show you Kyra asked me to Its really weird What is it Id rather show you but I left it in the glove compartment of the Scout Remind me when we go Yes I would This is some spooky shit seor she said Like the writing in the flour that time I thought about telling her I had my own fridgeafator people then didnt She had enough to worry about without that    or so I told myself We stood sidebyside on the grass watching Ki watch the juggler Did you call John I asked You bet His reaction She turned to me laughing with her eyes He actually sang a verse of Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead Wrong sex right sentiment She nodded her eyes going back to Kyra I thought again how beautiful she looked her body slim in the white dress her features clean and perfectly made Was he pissed at me inviting myself to lunch I asked Nope he loved the idea of having a party A party He loved the idea I began to feel rather small He even suggested we invite your lawyer from last Friday Mr Bissonette Plus the private detective John hired on Mr Bissonettes recommendation Is that okay with you Fine How about you Mattie Doing okay Doing okay she agreed turning to me I did have several more calls than usual today Im suddenly quite popular Uhoh Most were hangups but one gentleman took time enough to call me a cunt and there was a lady with a very strong Yankee accent who said Theah you bitch youve killed him Aaa you satisfied She hung up before I could tell her yes very satisfied thanks But Mattie didnt look satisfied she looked unhappy and guilty as if she had literally wished him dead Im sorry Its okay Really Kyra and I have been alone for a long time and Ive been scared for most of it Now Ive made a couple of friends If a few anonymous phone calls are the price I have to pay Ill pay it She was very close looking up at me and I couldnt stop myself I put the blame on summer her perfume and four years without a woman In that order i slipped my arms around her waist and remember perfectly the texture of her dress beneath my hands the slight pucker at the back where the zipper hid in its sleeve I remember the sensation of the cloth moving against the bare skin beneath Then I was kissing her very gently but very thoroughly  anything worth doing is worth doing right  and she was kissing me back in exactly the same spirit her mouth curious but not afraid Her lips were warm and smooth and held some faint sweet taste Peaches I think We stopped at the same time and pulled back a little from each other Her hands were still on my shoulders Mine were on the sides of her waist just above her hips Her face was composed enough but her eyes were more brilliant than ever and there were slants of color in her cheeks rising along the cheekbones Oh boy she said I really wanted that Ever since Ki tackled you and you picked her up Ive wanted it John wouldnt think much of us kissing in public I said My voice wasnt quite even and my heart was racing Seven seconds one kiss and every system in my body was redlining In fact John wouldnt think much of us kissing at all He fancies you you know I know but I fancy you She turned to check on Ki who was still standing obediently by the tree watching the juggler Who might be watching us Someone who had come over from the TR on a hot summer evening to get ice cream at Franks TasTFreeze and enjoy a little music and society on the common Someone who traded for fresh vegetables and fresh gossip at the Lakeview General A regular at the AllPurpose Garage This was insanity and it stayed insanity no matter how you cut it I dropped my hands from her waist Mattie they could put our picture next to indiscreet in the dictionary She took her hands off my shoulders and stepped back a pace but her brilliant eyes never left mine I know that Im young but not entirely stupid I didnt mean   She held up a hand to stop me Ki goes to bed around nine  she cant seem to sleep until its mostly dark I stay up later Come and visit me if you want to You can park around back She smiled a little It was a sweet smile it was also incredibly sexy Once the moons down thats an area of discretion Mattie youre young enough to be my daughter Maybe but Im not And sometimes people can be too discreet for their own good My body knew so emphatically what it wanted If we had been in her trailer at that moment it would have been no contest It was almost no contest anyway Then something recurred to me something Id thought about Devores ancestors and my own the generations didnt match up Wasnt the same thing true here And I dont believe that people automatically have a right to what they want no matter how badly they want it Not every thirst should be slaked Some things are just wrong  I guess thats what Im trying to say But I wasnt sure this was one of them and I wanted her all right So much I kept thinking about how her dress had slid when I put my arms around her waist the warm feel of her skin just beneath And no she wasnt my daughter You said your thanks I told her in a dry voice And thats enough Really You think this is gratitude She voiced a low tense laugh Youre forty Mike not eighty Youre not Harrison Ford but youre a goodlooking man Talented and interesting too And I like you such an awful lot I want you to be with me Do you want me to say please Fine Please be with me Yes this was about more than gratitude  I suppose Id known that even when I was using the word Id known she was wearing white shorts and a halter top when she called on the phone the day I went back to work Had she also known what I was wearing Had she dreamed she was in bed with me the two of us screwing our brains out while the party lights shone and Sara Tidwell played her version of the white nana rhyming game all that crazy Manderleysanderleycanderley stuff Had Mattie dreamed of telling me to do what she wanted And there were the fridgeafator people They were another kind of sharing an even spookier kind I hadnt quite had nerve enough to tell Mattie about mine but she might know anyway Down low in her mind Down below in her mind where the bluecollar guys moved around in the zone Her guys and my guys all part of the same strange labor union And maybe it wasnt an issue of morality per se at all Some thing about it  about us  just felt dangerous And oh so attractive I need time to think I said This isnt about what you think What do you feel for me So much it scares me Before I could say anything else my ears caught a familiar series of chordchanges I turned toward the kid with the guitar He had been working through a repertoire of early Dylan but now he swung into something chuggy and uptempo something that made you want to grin and pat your hands together Do you want to go fishin here in my fishin hole Said do you want to fish some honey here in my fishin hole You want to fish in my pond baby you better have a big long pole Fishin Blues Written by Sara Tidwell originally performed by Sara and the RedTop Boys covered by everyone from Ma Rainey to the Lovin Spoonful The raunchy ones had been her specialty doubleentendre so thin you could read a newspaper through it    although reading hadnt been Saras main interest judging by her lyrics Before the kid could go on to the next verse something about how you got to wiggle when you wobble and get that big one way down deep The Castle Rockers ran off a brass flourish that said Shut up everybody were comin atcha The kid quit playing his guitar the juggler began catching his Indian clubs and dropping them swiftly onto the grass in a line The Rockers launched themselves into an extremely evil Sousa march music to commit serial murders by and Kyra came running back to us The jugsters done Will you tell me the story Mike Hansel and Panzel Its Hansel and Gretel I said and Ill be happy to But lets go where its a little quieter okay The band is giving me a headache Music hurt your headie A little bit Well go by Matties car then Good thought Kyra ran ahead to stake out a bench on the edge of the common Mattie gave me a long warm look then her hand I took it Our fingers folded together as if they had been doing it for years I thought Id like it to be slow both of us hardly moving at all At first anyway And would I bring my nicest longest pole I think you could count on that And then afterward wed talk Maybe until we could see the furniture in the first early light When youre in bed with someone you love particularly for the first time five oclock seems almost holy You need a vacation from your own thoughts Mattie said I bet most writers do from time to time Thats probably true I wish we were home she said and I couldnt tell if her fierceness was real or pretend Id kiss you until this whole conversation became irrelevant And if there were second thoughts at least youd be having them in my bed I turned my face into the red light of the westering sun Here or there at this hour Ki would still be up True she said sounding uncharacteristically glum True Kyra reached a bench near the sign reading TOWN COMMON PARKING and climbed up on it holding the little stuffed dog from Mickey Ds in one hand I tried to pull my hand away as we approached her and Mattie held it firm Its all right Mike At VBS they hold hands with their friends everywhere they go Its big people who make it into a big deal She stopped looked at me I want you to know something Maybe it wont matter to you but it does to me There wasnt anyone before Lance and no one after If you come to me youll be my second Im not going to talk with you about this again either Saying please is all right but I wont beg I dont   Theres a pot with tomato plants in it by the trailer steps Ill leave a key under it Dont think Just come Not tonight Mattie I cant You can she replied Hurry up slowpokes Kyra cried bouncing on the bench Hes the slow one Mattie called back and poked me in the ribs Then in a much lower voice You are too She unwound her hand from mine and ran toward her daughter her brown legs scissoring below the hem of the white dress In my version of Hansel and Gretel the witch was named Depravia Kyra stared at me with huge eyes when I got to the part where Depravia asks Hansel to poke out his finger so she can see how plump hes getting Is it too scary I asked Ki shook her head emphatically I glanced at Mattie to make sure She nodded and waved a hand for me to go on so I finished the story Depravia went into the oven and Gretel found her secret stash of winning lottery tickets The kids bought a Jet Ski and lived happily ever after on the eastern side of Dark Score Lake By then The Castle Rockers were slaughtering Gershwin and sunset was nigh I carried Kyra to Scoutie and strapped her in I remembered the first time Id helped put the kid into her carseat and the inadvertent press of Matties breast I hope there isnt a bad dream for you in that story I said Until I heard it coming out of my own mouth I hadnt realized how fundamentally awful that one is I wont have bad dreams Kyra said matteroffactly The fridgeafator people will keep them away Then carefully reminding herself Reefridgearator She turned to Mattie Show him the crosspatch Mommybommy Crossword But thanks I wouldve forgotten She thumbed open the glove compartment and took out a folded sheet of paper It was on the fridge this morning I copied it down because Ki said youd know what it meant She said you do crossword puzzles Well she said crosspatches but I got the idea Had I told Kyra that I did crosswords Almost certainly not Did it surprise me that she knew Not at all I took the sheet of paper unfolded it and looked at what was printed there d go w ninety Is it a crosspatch puzzle Mike Kyra asked I guess so  a very simple one But if it means something I dont know what it is May I keep this Yes Mattie said I walked her around to the drivers side of the Scout reaching for her hand again as we went Just give me a little time I know thats supposed to be the girls line but   Take the time she said Just dont take too much I didnt want to take any which was just the problem The sex would be great I knew that But after There might be an after though I knew it and she did too With Mattie after was a real possibility The idea was a little scary a little wonderful I kissed the corner of her mouth She laughed and grabbed me by the earlobe You can do better she said then looked at Ki who was sitting in her carseat and gazing at us interestedly But Ill let you off this time Kiss Ki Kyra called holding out her arms so I went around and kissed Ki Driving home wearing my dark glasses to cut the glare of the setting sun it occurred to me that maybe I could be Kyra Devores father That seemed almost as attractive to me as going to bed with her mother which was a measure of how deep I was in And going deeper maybe Deeper still Sara Laughs seemed very empty after having Mattie in my arms  a sleeping head without dreams I checked the letters on the fridge saw nothing there but the normal scatter and got a beer I went out on the deck to drink it while I watched the last of the sunset I tried to think about the refrigerator people and crosspatches that had appeared on both refrigerators go down nineteen on Lane Fortytwo and go down ninetytwo on Wasp Hill Road Different vectors from the land to the lake Different spots on The Street Shit who knew I tried to think about John Storrow and how unhappy he was apt to be if he found out there was  to quote Sara Laughs who got to the line long before John Mellencamp  another mule kicking in Mattie Devores stall But mostly what I thought about was holding her for the first time kissing her for the first time No human instinct is more powerful than the sexdrive when it is fully aroused and its awakening images are emotional tattoos that never leave us For me it was feeling the soft bare skin of her waist just beneath her dress The slippery feel of the fabric    I turned abruptly and hurried through the house to the north wing almost running and shedding clothes as I went I turned the shower on to full cold and stood under it for five minutes shivering When I got out I felt a little more like an actual human being and a little less like a twitching bundle of nerve endings And as I toweled dry something else recurred to me At some point I had thought of Jos brother Frank had thought that if anyone besides myself would be able to feel Jos presence in Sara Laughs it would be him I hadnt gotten around to inviting him down yet and now wasnt sure I wanted to I had come to feel oddly possessive almost jealous about what was happening here And yet if Jo had been writing something on the quiet Frank might know Of course she hadnt confided in him about the pregnancy but  I looked at my watch Quarter past nine In the trailer near the intersection of Wasp Hill Road and Route  Kyra was probably already asleep    and her mother might already have put her extra key under the pot near the steps I thought of her in the white dress the swell of her hips just below my hands and the smell of her perfume then pushed the images away I couldnt spend the whole night taking cold showers Quarter past nine was still early enough to call Frank Arlen He picked up on the second ring sounding both happy to hear from me and as if hed gotten three or four cans further into the sixpack than I had so far done We passed the usual pleasantries back and forth  most of my own almost entirely fictional I was dismayed to find  and he mentioned that a famous neighbor of mine had kicked the bucket according to the news Had I met him Yes I said remembering how Max Devore had run his wheelchair at me Yes Id met him Frank wanted to know what he was like That was hard to say I told him Poor old guy was stuck in a wheelchair and suffering from emphysema Pretty frail huh Frank asked sympathetically Yeah I said Listen Frank I called about Jo I was out in her studio looking around and I found my typewriter Since then Ive kind of gotten the idea she was writing something It might have started as a little piece about our house then widened The place is named after Sara Tidwell you know The blues singer A long pause Then Frank said I know His voice sounded heavy grave What else do you know Frank That she was scared I think she found out something that scared her I think that mostly because   That was when the light finally broke I probably should have known from Matties description would have known if I hadnt been so upset You were down here with her werent you In July of  You went to the softball game then you went back up The Street to the house How do you know that he almost barked Someone saw you A friend of mine I was trying not to sound mad and not succeeding I was mad but it was a relieved anger the kind you feel when your kid comes dragging into the house with a shamefaced grin just as youre getting ready to call the cops I almost told you a day or two before we buried her We were in that pub do you remember Jacks Pub right after Frank had beaten the funeral director down on the price of Jos coffin Sure I remembered I even remembered the look in his eyes when Id told him Jo had been pregnant when she died He must have felt the silence spinning out because he came back sounding anxious Mike I hope you didnt get any   What Wrong ideas I thought maybe she was having an affair hows that for a wrong idea You can call that ignoble if you want but I had my reasons There was a lot she wasnt telling me What did she tell you Next to nothing Did you know she quit all her boards and committees Quit and never said a word to me No I didnt think he was lying Why would he at this late date Jesus Mike if Id known that   What happened the day you came down here Tell me I was at the printshop in Sanford Jo called me from    I dont remember I think a rest area on the turnpike Between Derry and the TR Yeah She was on her way to Sara Laughs and wanted me to meet her there She told me to park in the driveway if I got there first not to go in the house    which I could have I know where you keep the spare key Sure he did in a Sucrets tin under the deck I had shown him myself Did she say why she didnt want you to go inside Itll sound crazy No it wont Believe me She said the house was dangerous For a moment the words just hung there Then I asked Did you get here first Uhhuh And waited outside Yes Did you see or sense anything dangerous There was a long pause At last he said There were lots of people out on the lake  speedboaters waterskiers you know how it is  but all the enginenoise and the laughter seemed to kind of    stop dead when it got near the house Have you ever noticed that it seems quiet there even when its not Of course I had Sara seemed to exist in its own zone of silence Did it feel dangerous though No he said almost reluctantly Not to me anyway But it didnt feel exactly empty either I felt    fuck I felt watched I sat on one of those railroadtie steps and waited for my sis Finally she came She parked behind my car and hugged me    but she never took her eyes off the house I asked her what she was up to and she said she couldnt tell me and that I couldnt tell you wed been there She said something like If he finds out on his own then its meant to be Ill have to tell him sooner or later anyway But I cant now because I need his whole attention I cant get that while hes working I felt a flush crawl across my skin She said that huh Yeah Then she said she had to go in the house and do something She wanted me to wait outside She said if she called I should come on the run Otherwise I should just stay where I was She wanted someone there in case she got in trouble Yeah but it had to be someone who wouldnt ask a lot of questions she didnt want to answer That was me I guess that was always me And She went inside I sat on the hood of my car smoking cigarettes I was still smoking then And you know I did start to feel something then that wasnt right As if there might be someone in the house whod been waiting for her someone who didnt like her Maybe someone who wanted to hurt her Probably I just picked that up from Jo  the way her nerves seemed all strung up the way she kept looking over my shoulder at the house even while she was hugging me  but it seemed like something else Like a    I dont know     Like a vibe Yes he almost shouted A vibration But not a good vibration like in the Beach Boys song A bad vibration What happened I sat and waited I only smoked two cigarettes so I dont guess it could have been longer than twenty minutes or half an hour but it seemed longer I kept noticing how the sounds from the lake seemed to make it most of the way up the hill and then just kind of    quit And how there didnt seem to be any birds except far off in the distance Once she came out I heard the deck door bang and then her footsteps on the stairs over on that side I called to her asked if she was okay and she said fine She said for me to stay where I was She sounded a little short of breath as if she was carrying something or had been doing some chore Did she go to her studio or down to the lake I dont know She was gone another fifteen minutes or so  time enough for me to smoke another butt  and then she came back out the front door She checked to make sure it was locked and then she came up to me She looked a lot better Relieved The way people look when they do some dirty job theyve been putting off finally get it behind them She suggested we walk down that path she called The Street to the resort thats down there   Warringtons Right right She said shed buy me a beer and a sandwich Which she did out at the end of this long floating dock The Sunset Bar where I had first glimpsed Rogette Then you went to have a look at the softball game That was Jos idea She had three beers to my one and she insisted Said someone was going to hit a longshot homer into the trees she just knew it Now I had a clear picture of the part Mattie had seen and told me about Whatever Jo had done it had left her almost giddy with relief She had ventured into the house for one thing Had dared the spirits in order to do her business and survived Shed had three beers to celebrate and her discretion had slipped    not that she had behaved with any great stealth on her previous trips down to the TR Frank remembered her saying if I found out on my own then it was meant to be  que ser ser It wasnt the attitude of someone hiding an affair and I realized now that all her behavior suggested a woman keeping a shortterm secret She would have told me when I finished my stupid book if she had lived If You watched the game for awhile then went back to the house along The Street Yes he said Did either of you go in No By the time we got there her buzz had worn off and I trusted her to drive She was laughing while we were at the softball game but she wasnt laughing by the time we got back to the house She looked at it and said Im done with her Ill never go through that door again Frank My skin first chilled then prickled I asked her what was wrong what shed found out I knew she was writing something shed told me that much   She told everyone but me I said    but without much bitterness I knew who the man in the brown sportcoat had been and any bitterness or anger  anger at Jo anger at myself  paled before the relief of that I hadnt realized how much that fellow had been on my mind until now She must have had her reasons Frank said You know that dont you But she didnt tell you what they were All I know is that it started  whatever it was  with her doing research for an article It was a lark Jo playing Nancy Drew Im pretty sure that at first not telling you was just to keep it a surprise She read books but mostly she talked to people  listened to their stories of the old days and teased them into looking for old letters    diaries    she was good at that part of it I think Damned good You dont know any of this No I said heavily Jo hadnt been having an affair but she could have had one if shed wanted She could have had an affair with Tom Selleck and been written up in Inside View and I would have gone on tapping away at the keys of my Powerbook blissfully unaware Whatever she found out Frank said I think she just stumbled over it And you never told me Four years and you never told me any of it That was the last time I was with her Frank said and now he didnt sound apologetic or embarrassed at all And the last thing she asked of me was that I not tell you wed been to the lake house She said shed tell you everything when she was ready but then she died After that I didnt think it mattered Mike she was my sister She was my sister and I promised All right I understand And I did  just not enough What had Jo discovered That Normal Auster had drowned his infant son under a handpump That back around the turn of the century an animal trap had been left in a place where a young Negro boy would be apt to come along and step into it That another boy perhaps the incestuous child of Son and Sara Tidwell had been drowned by his mother in the lake she maybe laughing that smokebroken lunatic laugh as she held him down You gotta wiggle when you wobble honey and hold that young un way down deep If you need me to apologize Mike consider it done I dont Frank do you remember anything else she might have said that night Anything at all She said she knew how you found the house She said what She said that when it wanted you it called you At first I couldnt reply because Frank Arlen had completely demolished one of the assumptions Id made about my married life  one of the biggies one of those that seem so basic you dont even think about questioning them Gravity holds you down Light allows you to see The compass needle points north Stuff like that This assumption was that Jo was the one who had wanted to buy Sara Laughs back when we saw the first real money from my writing career because Jo was the house person in our marriage just as I was the car person Jo was the one who had picked our apartments when apartments were all we could afford Jo who hung a picture here and asked me to put up a shelf there Jo was the one who had fallen in love with the Derry house and had finally worn down my resistance to the idea that it was too big too busy and too broken to take on Jo had been the nestbuilder She said that when it wanted you it called you And it was probably true No I could do better than that if I was willing to set aside the lazy thinking and selective remembering It was certainly true I was the one who had first broached the idea of a place in western Maine I was the one who collected stacks of realestate brochures and hauled them home Id started buying regional magazines like Down East and always began at the back where the realestate ads were It was I who had first seen a picture of Sara Laughs in a glossy handout called Maine Retreats and it was I who had made the call first to the agent named in the ad and then to Marie Hingerman after badgering Maries name out of the Realtor Johanna had also been charmed by Sara Laughs  I think anyone would have been charmed by it seeing it for the first time in autumn sunshine with the trees blazing all around it and drifts of colored leaves blowing up The Street  but it was I who had actively sought the place out Except that was more lazy thinking and selective remembering Wasnt it Sara had sought me out Then how could I not have known it until now And how was I led here in the first place full of unknowing happy ignorance The answer to both questions was the same It was also the answer to the question of how Jo could have discovered something distressing about the house the lake maybe the whole TR and then gotten away with not telling me Id been gone thats all Id been zoning tranced out writing one of my stupid little books Id been hypnotized by the fantasies going on in my head and a hypnotized man is easy to lead Mike Are you still there Im here Frank But Ill be goddamned if I know what could have scared her so She mentioned one other name I remember Royce Merrill She said he was the one who remembered the most because he was so old And she said I dont want Mike to talk to him Im afraid that old man might let the cat out of the bag and tell him more than he should know Any idea what she meant Well    its been suggested that a splinter from the old family tree wound up here but my mothers people are from Memphis The Noonans are from Maine but not from this part Yet I no longer entirely believed this Mike you sound almost sick Im okay Better than I was actually And you understand why I didnt tell you any of this until now I mean if Id known the ideas you were getting    if Id had any clue     I think I understand The ideas didnt belong in my head to begin with but once that shit starts to creep in     When I got back to Sanford that night and it was over I guess I thought it was just more of Jos Oh fuck theres a shadow on the moon nobody go out until tomorrow She was always the superstitious one you know  knocking on wood tossing a pinch of salt over her shoulder if she spilled some those fourleafclover earrings she used to have     Or the way she wouldnt wear a pullover if she put it on backward by mistake I said She claimed doing that would turn around your whole day Well Doesnt it Frank asked and I could hear a little smile in his voice All at once I remembered Jo completely right down to the small gold flecks in her left eye and wanted nobody else Nobody else would do She thought there was something bad about the house Frank said That much I do know I drew a piece of paper to me and jotted Kia on it Yes And by then she may have suspected she was pregnant She might have been afraid of    influences There were influences here all right You think she got most of this from Royce Merrill No that was just a name she mentioned She probably talked to dozens of people Do you know a guy named Kloster Gloster Something like that Skuster I said Below Kia my pencil was making a series of fat loops that might have been cursive letter ls or hair ribbons Kenny Auster Was that it It sounds right In any case you know how she was once she really got going on a thing Yes Like a terrier after rats Mike Should I come up there No Now I was sure Not Harold Oblowski not Frank either There was a process going on in Sara something as delicate and as organic as rising bread in a warm room Frank might interrupt that process    or be hurt by it No I just wanted to get it cleared up Besides Im writing Its hard for me to have people around when Im writing Will you call if I can help You bet I said I hung up the telephone thumbed through the book and found a listing for R MERRILL on the Deep Bay Road I called the number listened to it ring a dozen times then hung up No newfangled answering machine for Royce I wondered idly where he was Ninetyfive seemed a little too old to go dancing at the Country Barn in Harrison especially on a close night like this one I looked at the paper with Kia written on it Below the fat lshapes I wrote Kyra and remembered how the first time Id heard Ki say her name Id thought it was Kia she was saying Below Kyra I wrote Kito hesitated then wrote Carla I put these names in a box Beside them I jotted Johanna Bridget and Jared The fridgeafator people Folks who wanted me to go down nineteen and go down ninetytwo Go down Moses you bound for the Promised Land I told the empty house I looked around Just me and Bunter and the waggy clock    except it wasnt When it wanted you it called you I got up to get another beer The fruits and vegetables were in a circle again In the middle the letters now spelled lye stille As on some old tombstones  God grant she lye stille I looked at these letters for a long time Then I remembered the IBM was still out on the deck I brought it in plonked it on the diningroom table and began to work on my current stupid little book Fifteen minutes and I was lost only faintly aware of thunder someplace over the lake only faintly aware of Bunters bell shivering from time to time When I went back to the fridge an hour or so later for another beer and saw that the words in the circle now said ony lye stille I hardly noticed At that moment I didnt care if they lay stille or danced the hucklebuck by the light of the silvery moon John Shackleford had begun to remember his past and the child whose only friend he John had been Little neglected Ray Garraty I wrote until midnight came By then the thunder had faded away but the heat held on as oppressive as a blanket I turned off the IBM and went to bed    thinking so far as I can remember nothing at all  not even about Mattie lying in her own bed not so many miles away The writing had burned off all thoughts of the real world at least temporarily I think that in the end thats what its for Good or bad it passes the time I was walking north along The Street Japanese lanterns lined it but they were all dark because it was daylight bright daylight The muggy smutchy look of midJuly was gone the sky was that deep sapphire shade which is the sole property of October The lake was deepest indigo beneath it sparkling with sunpoints The trees were just past the peak of their autumn colors burning like torches A wind out of the south blew the fallen leaves past me and between my legs in rattly fragrant gusts The Japanese lanterns nodded as if in approval of the season Up ahead faintly I could hear music Sara and the RedTops Sara was belting it out laughing her way through the lyric as she always had    only how could laughter sound so much like a snarl White boy Id never kill a child of mine That youd even think it I whirled expecting to see her right behind me but there was no one there Well    The Green Lady was there only she had changed her dress of leaves for autumn and become the Yellow Lady The bare pinebranch behind her still pointed the way go north young man go north Not much farther down the path was another birch the one Id held onto when that terrible drowning sensation had come over me again I waited for it to come again now  for my mouth and throat to fill up with the iron taste of the lake  but it didnt happen I looked back at the Yellow Lady then beyond her to Sara Laughs The house was there but much reduced no north wing no south wing no second story No sign of Jos studio off to the side either None of those things had been built yet The ladybirch had travelled back with me from  so had the one hanging over the lake Otherwise  Where am I I asked the Yellow Lady and the nodding Japanese lanterns Then a better question occurred to me When am I No answer Its a dream isnt it Im in bed and dreaming Somewhere out in the brilliant goldsparkling net of the lake a loon called Twice Hoot once for yes twice for no I thought Not a dream Michael I dont know exactly what it is  spiritual timetravel maybe  but its not a dream Is this really happening I asked the day and from somewhere back in the trees where a track which would eventually come to be known as Lane Fortytwo ran toward a dirt road which would eventually come to be known as Route  a crow cawed Just once I went to the birch hanging over the lake slipped an arm around it doing it lit a trace memory of slipping my hands around Matties waist feeling her dress slide over her skin and peered into the water halfwanting to see the drowned boy halffearing to see him There was no boy there but something lay on the bottom where he had been among the rocks and roots and waterweed I squinted and just then the wind died a little stilling the glints on the water It was a cane one with a gold head A Boston Post cane Wrapped around it in a rising spiral their ends waving lazily were what appeared to be a pair of ribbons  white ones with bright red edges Seeing Royces cane wrapped that way made me think of highschool graduations and the baton the class marshal waves as he or she leads the gowned seniors to their seats Now I understood why the old crock hadnt answered the phone Royce Merrills phoneanswering days were all done I knew that I also knew I had come to a time before Royce had even been born Sara Tidwell was here I could hear her singing and when Royce had been born in  Sara had already been gone for two years she and her whole RedTop family Go down Moses I told the ribbonwrapped cane in the water You bound for the Promised Land I walked on toward the sound of the music invigorated by the cool air and rushing wind Now I could hear voices as well lots of them talking and shouting and laughing Rising above them and pumping like a piston was the hoarse cry of a sideshow barker Come on in folks hurray hurray hurray Its all on the inside but youve got to hurray next show starts in ten minutes See Angelina the SnakeWoman she shimmies she shakes shell bewitch your eye and steal your heart but dont get too close for her bite is poyson See Hando the DogFaced Boy terror of the South Seas See the Human Skeleton See the Human Gila Monster relic of a time God forgot See the Bearded Lady and all the Killer Martians Its on the inside yessirree so hurray hurray hurray I could hear the steamdriven calliope of a merrygoround and the bang of the bell at the top of the post as some lumberjack won a stuffed toy for his sweetie You could tell from the delighted feminine screams that hed hit it almost hard enough to pop it off the post There was the snap of s from the shooting gallery the snoring moo of someones prize cow    and now I began to smell the aromas I have associated with county fairs since I was a boy sweet fried dough grilled onions and peppers cotton candy manure hay I began to walk faster as the strum of guitars and thud of double basses grew louder My heart kicked into a higher gear I was going to see them perform actually see Sara Laughs and the RedTops live and on stage This was no crazy threepart feverdream either This was happening right now so hurray hurray hurray The Washburn place the one that would always be the Bricker place to Mrs M was gone Beyond where it would eventually be rising up the steep slope on the eastern side of The Street was a flight of broad wooden stairs They reminded me of the ones which lead down from the amusement park to the beach at Old Orchard Here the Japanese lanterns were lit in spite of the brightness of the day and the music was louder than ever Sara was singing Jimmy Crack Corn I climbed the stairs toward the laughter and shouts the sounds of the RedTops and the calliope the smells of fried food and farm animals Above the stairhead was a wooden arch with WELCOME TO FRYEBURG FAIR WELCOME TO THE TH CENTURY printed on it As I watched a little boy in short pants and a woman wearing a shirtwaist and an anklelength linen skirt walked under the arch and toward me They shimmered grew gauzy For a moment I could see their skeletons and the bone grins which lurked beneath their laughing faces A moment later and they were gone Two farmers  one wearing a straw hat the other gesturing expansively with a corncob pipe  appeared on the Fair side of the arch in exactly the same fashion In this way I understood that there was a barrier between The Street and the Fair Yet I did not think it was a barrier which would affect me I was an exception Is that right I asked Can I go in The bell at the top of the Test Your Strength pole banged loud and clear Bong once for yes twice for no I continued on up the stairs Now I could see the Ferris wheel turning against the brilliant sky the wheel that had been in the background of the band photo in Osteens Dark Score Days The framework was metal but the brightly painted gondolas were made of wood Leading up to it like an aisle leading up to an altar was a broad sawduststrewn midway The sawdust was there for a purpose almost every man I saw was chewing tobacco I paused for a few seconds at the top of the stairs still on the lake side of the arch I was afraid of what might happen to me if I passed under Afraid of dying or disappearing yes but mostly of never being able to return the way I had come of being condemned to spend eternity as a visitor to the turnofthecentury Fryeburg Fair That was also like a Ray Bradbury story now that I thought of it In the end what drew me into that other world was Sara Tidwell I had to see her with my own eyes I had to watch her sing Had to I felt a tingling as I stepped beneath the arch and there was a sighing in my ears as of a million voices very far away Sighing in relief Dismay I couldnt tell All I knew for sure was that being on the other side was different  the difference between looking at a thing through a window and actually being there the difference between observing and participating Colors jumped out like ambushers at the moment of attack The smells which had been sweet and evocative and nostalgic on the lake side of the arch were now rough and sexy prose instead of poetry I could smell dense sausages and frying beef and the vast shadowy aroma of boiling chocolate Two kids walked past me sharing a paper cone of cotton candy Both of them were clutching knotted hankies with their little bits of change in them Hey kids a barker in a dark blue shirt called to them He was wearing sleevegarters and his smile revealed one splendid gold tooth Knock over the milkbottles and win a prize I ent had a loser all day Up ahead the RedTops swung into Fishin Blues Id thought the kid on the common in Castle Rock was pretty good but this version made the kids sound old and slow and clueless It wasnt cute like an antique picture of ladies with their skirts held up to their knees dancing a decorous version of the black bottom with the edges of their bloomers showing It wasnt something Alan Lomax had collected with his other folk songs just one more dusty American butterfly in a glass case full of them this was smut with just enough shine on it to keep the whole struttin bunch of them out of jail Sara Tidwell was singing about the dirty boogie and I guessed that every overalled strawhatted plugchewing callushanded clodhopperwearing farmer standing in front of the stage was dreaming about doing it with her getting right down to where the sweat forms in the crease and the heat gets hot and the pink comes glimmering through I started walking in that direction aware of cows mooing and sheep blatting from the exhibition barns  the Fairs version of my childhood HiHo DairyO I walked past the shooting gallery and the ringtoss and the pennypitch I walked past a stage where The Handmaidens of Angelina were weaving in a slow snakelike dance with their hands pressed together as a guy with a turban on his head and shoepolish on his face tooted a flute The picture painted on stretched canvas suggested that Angelina  on view inside for just one tenth of a dollar neighbor  would make these two look like old boots I walked past the entrance to Freak Alley the cornroasting pit the Ghost House where more stretched canvas depicted spooks coming out of broken windows and crumbling chimneys Everything in there is death I thought    but from inside I could hear children who were very much alive laughing and squealing as they bumped into things in the dark The older among them were likely stealing kisses I passed the Test Your Strength pole where the gradations leading to the brass bell at the top were marked BABY NEEDS HIS BOTTLE SISSY TRY AGAIN BIG BOY HEMAN and just below the bell itself in red HERCULES Standing at the center of a little crowd a young man with red hair was removing his shirt revealing a heavily muscled upper torso A cigarsmoking carny held a hammer out to him I passed the quilting booth a tent where people were sitting on benches and playing Bingo the baseball pitch I passed them all and hardly noticed I was in the zone tranced out Youll have to call him back Jo had sometimes told Harold when he phoned Michael is currently in the Land of Big MakeBelieve Only now nothing felt like pretend and the only thing that interested me was the stage at the base of the Ferris wheel There were eight black folks up there on it maybe ten Standing at the front wearing a guitar and whaling on it as she sang was Sara Tidwell She was alive She was in her prime She threw back her head and laughed at the October sky What brought me out of this daze was a cry from behind me Wait up Mike Wait up I turned and saw Kyra running toward me dodging around the strollers and gamesters and midway gawkers with her pudgy knees pumping She was wearing a little white sailor dress with red piping and a straw hat with a navyblue ribbon on it In one hand she clutched Strickland and when she got to me she threw herself confidently forward knowing I would catch her and swing her up I did and when her hat started to fall offi caught it and jammed it back on her head I taggled my own quartermack she said and laughed Again Thats right I said Youre a regular Mean Joe Green I was wearing overalls the tail of a washfaded blue bandanna stuck out of the bib pocket and manurestained workboots I looked at Kyras white socks and saw they were homemade I would find no discreet little label reading Made in Mexico or Made in China if I took off her straw hat and looked inside either This hat had been most likely Made in Motton by some farmers wife with red hands and achy joints Ki wheres Mattie Home I guess She couldnt come How did you get here Up the stairs It was a lot of stairs You should have waited for me You could have carrot me like before I want to hear the music Me too Do you know who that is Kyra Yes she said Kitos mom Hurry up slowpoke I walked toward the stage thinking wed have to stand at the back of the crowd but they parted for us as we came forward me carrying Kyra in my arms  the lovely sweet weight of her a little Gibson Girl in her sailor dress and ribbonaccented straw hat Her arm was curled around my neck and they parted for us like the Red Sea had parted for Moses They didnt turn to look at us either They were clapping and stomping and bellowing along with the music totally involved They stepped aside unconsciously as if some kind of magnetism were at work here  ours positive theirs negative The few women in the crowd were blushing but clearly enjoying themselves one of them laughing so hard tears were streaming down her face She looked no more than twentytwo or three Kyra pointed to her and said matteroffactly You know Matties boss at the liberry Thats her nana Lindy Briggss grandmother and fresh as a daisy I thought Good Christ The RedTops were spread across the stage and under swags of red white and blue bunting like some timetravelling rock band I recognized all of them from the picture in Edward Osteens book The men wore white shirts armgarters dark vests dark pants Son Tidwell at the far end of the stage was wearing the derby hed had on in the photo Sara though    Why is the lady wearing Matties dress Kyra asked me and she began to tremble I dont know honey I cant say Nor could I argue  it was the white sleeveless dress Mattie had been wearing on the common all right On stage the band was smoking through an instrumental break Reginald Son Tidwell strolled over to Sara feet ambling hands a brown blur on the strings and frets of his guitar and she turned to face him They put their foreheads together she laughing and he solemn they looked into each others eyes and tried to play each other down the crowd cheering and clapping the rest of the RedTops laughing as they played Seeing them together like that I realized that I had been right they were brother and sister The resemblance was too strong to be missed or mistaken But mostly what I looked at was the way her hips and butt switched in that white dress Kyra and I might be dressed in turnofthecentury country clothes but Sara was thoroughly modern Millie No bloomers for her no petticoats no cotton stockings No one seemed to notice that she was wearing a dress that stopped above her knees  that she was all but naked by the standards of this time And under Matties dress shed be wearing garments the like of which these people had never seen a Lycra bra and hiphugger nylon panties If I put my hands on her waist the dress would slip not against an unwetcoming corset but against soft bare skin Brown skin not white What do you want sugar Sara backed away from Son shaking her ungirdled unbustled fanny and laughing He strolled back to his spot and she turned to the crowd as the band played the turnaround She sang the next verse looking directly at me Before you start in fishin you better check your line Said before you start in fishin honey you better check on your line Ill pull on yours darling and you best tug on mine The crowd roared happily In my arms Kyra was shaking harder than ever Im scared Mike she said I dont like that lady Shes a scary lady She stole Matties dress I want to go home It was as if Sara heard her even over the rip and ram of the music Her head cocked back on her neck her lips peeled open and she laughed at the sky Her teeth were big and yellow They looked like the teeth of a hungry animal and I decided I agreed with Kyra she was a scary lady Okay hon I murmured in Kis ear Were out of here But before I could move the sense of the woman  I dont know how else to say it  fell upon me and held me Now I understood what had shot past me in the kitchen to knock away the CARLADEAN letters the chill was the same It was almost like identifying a person by the sound of their walk She led the band to the turnaround once more then into another verse Not one youd find in any written version of the song though I aint gonna hurt her honey not for all the treasure in the world Said I wouldnt hurt your baby not for diamonds or for pearls Only one blackhearted bastard dare to touch that little girl The crowd roared as if it were the funniest thing theyd ever heard but Kyra began to cry Sara saw this and stuck out her breasts  much bigger breasts than Matties  and shook them at her laughing her trademark laugh as she did There was a parodic coldness about this gesture    and an emptiness too A sadness Yet I could feel no compassion for her It was as if the heart had been burned out of her and the sadness which remained was just another ghost the memory of love haunting the bones of hate And how her laughing teeth leered Sara raised her arms over her head and this time shook it all the way down as if reading my thoughts and mocking them Just like jelly on a plate as some other old song of the time has it Her shadow wavered on the canvas backdrop which was a painting of Fryeburg and as I looked at it I realized I had found the Shape from my Manderley dreams It was Sara Sara was the Shape and always had been No Mike Thats close but its not right Right or wrong Id had enough I turned putting my hand on the back of Kis head and urging her face down against my chest Both her arms were around my neck now clutching with panicky tightness I thought Id have to bull my way back through the crowd  they had let me in easily enough but they might be a lot less amenable to letting me back out Dont fuck with me boys I thought You dont want to do that And they didnt On stage Son Tidwell had taken the band from E to G someone began to bang a tambourine and Sara went from Fishin Blues to Dog My Cats without a single pause Out here in front of the stage and below it the crowd once more drew back from me and my little girl without looking at us or missing a beat as they clapped their workswollen hands together One young man with a portwine stain swimming across the side of his face opened his mouth  at twenty he was already missing half his teeth  and hollered YeeHAW around a melting glob of tobacco It was Buddy Jellison from the Village Cafe I realized    Buddy Jellison magically rolled back in age from sixtyeight to eighteen Then I realized the hair was the wrong shade  light brown instead of black although he was pushing seventy and looking it in every other way Bud hadnt a single white hair in his head This was Buddys grandfather maybe even his greatgrandfather I didnt give a shit either way I only wanted to get out of here Excuse me I said brushing by him Theres no town drunk here you meddling son of a bitch he said never looking at me and never missing a beat as he clapped We all just take turns Its a dream after all I thought Its a dream and that proves it But the smell of tobacco on his breath wasnt a dream the smell of the crowd wasnt a dream and the weight of the frightened child in my arms wasnt a dream either My shirt was hot and wet where her face was pressed She was crying Hey Irish Sara called from the stage and her voice was so like Jos that I could have screamed She wanted me to turn back  I could feel her will working on the sides of my face like fingers  but I wouldnt do it I dodged around three farmers who were passing a ceramic bottle from hand to hand and then I was free of the crowd The midway lay ahead wide as Fifth Avenue and at the end of it was the arch the steps The Street the lake Home If I could get to The Street wed be safe I was sure of it Almost done Irish Sara shrieked after me She sounded angry but not too angry to laugh You gonna get what you want sugar all the comfort you need but you want to let me finish my biness Do you hear me boy Just stand clear Mind me now I began to hurry back the way I had come stroking Kis head still holding her face against my shirt Her straw hat fell off and when I grabbed for it I got nothing but the ribbon which pulled free of the brim No matter We had to get out of here On our left was the baseball pitch and some little boy shouting Willy hit it over the fence Ma Willy hit it over the fence with monotonous braincroggling regularity We passed the Bingo where some woman howled that she had won the turkey by glory every number was covered with a button and she had won the turkey Overhead the sun dove behind a cloud and the day went dull Our shadows disappeared The arch at the end of the midway drew closer with maddening slowness Are we home yet Ki almost moaned I want to go home Mike please take me home to my mommy I will I said Everythings going to be all right We were passing the Test Your Strength pole where the young man with the red hair was putting his shirt back on He looked at me with stolid dislike  the instinctive mistrust of a native for an interloper perhaps  and I realized I knew him too Hed have a grandson named Dickie who would toward the end of the century to which this fair had been dedicated own the AllPurpose Garage on Route  A woman coming out of the quilting booth stopped and pointed at me At the same moment her upper lip lifted in a dogs snarl I knew that face too From where Somewhere around town It didnt matter and I didnt want to know even if it did We never should have come here Ki moaned I know how you feel I said But I dont think we had any choice hon We   They came out of Freak Alley perhaps twenty yards ahead I saw them and stopped There were seven in all longstriding men dressed in cutters clothes but four didnt matter  those four looked faded and white and ghostly They were sick fellows maybe dead fellows and no more dangerous than daguerreotypes The other three though were real As real as the rest of this place anyway The leader was an old man wearing a faded blue Union Army cap He looked at me with eyes I knew Eyes I had seen measuring me over the top of an oxygen mask Mike Why we stoppin Its all right Ki Just keep your head down This is all a dream Youll wake up tomorrow morning in your own bed Kay The jacks spread across the midway hand to hand and boot to boot blocking our way back to the arch and The Street Old BlueCap was in the middle The ones on either side of him were much younger some by maybe as much as half a century Two of the pale ones the almostnotthere ones were standing sidebyside to the old mans right and I wondered if I could burst through that part of their line I thought they were no more flesh than the thing which had thumped the insulation of the cellar wall    but what if I was wrong Give her over son the old man said His voice was reedy and implacable He held out his hands It was Max Devore he had come back even in death he was seeking custody Yet it wasnt him I knew it wasnt The planes of this mans face were subtly different the cheeks gaunter the eyes a brighter blue Where am I I called to him accenting the last word heavily and in front of Angelinas booth the man in the turban a Hindu who perhaps hailed from Sandusky Ohio put down his flute and simply watched The snakegirls stopped dancing and watched too slipping their arms around each other and drawing together for comfort Where am I Devore If our greatgrandfathers shit in the same pit then where am I Aint here to answer your questions Give her over Ill take her Jared one of the younger menone of those who were really there  said He looked at Devore with a kind of fawning eagerness that sickened me mostly because I knew who he was Bill Deans father A man who had grown up to be one of the most respected elders in Castle County was all but licking Devores boots Dont think too badly of him Jo whispered Dont think too badly of any of them They were very young You dont need to do nothing Devore said His reedy voice was irritated Fred Dean looked abashed Hes going to hand her over on his own And if he dont well take her together I looked at the man on the far left the third of those that seemed totally real totally there Was this me It didnt look like me There was something in the face that seemed familiar but  Hand her over Irish Devore said Last chance No Devore nodded as if this was exactly what he had expected Then well take her This has got to end Come on boys They started toward me and as they did I realized who the one on the end  the one in the caulked treewalker boots and flannel loggers pants  reminded me of Kenny Auster whose wolfhound would eat cake til it busted Kenny Auster whose baby brother had been drowned under the pump by Kennys father I looked behind me The RedTops were still playing Sara was still laughing shaking her hips with her hands in the sky and the crowd was still plugging the east end of the midway That way was no good anyway if I went that way Id end up raising a little girl in the early years of the twentieth century trying to make a living by writing penny dreadfuls and dime novels That might not be so bad    but there was a lonely young woman miles and years from here who would miss her Who might even miss us both I turned back and saw the jackboys were almost on me Some of them more here than others more vital but all of them dead All of them damned I looked at the towhead whose descendants would include Kenny Auster and asked him What did you do What in Christs name did you men do He held out his hands Give her over Irish Thats all you have to do You and the woman can have more All the more you want Shes young shell pop em out like watermelon seeds I was hypnotized and they would have taken us if not for Kyra Whats happening she screamed against my shirt Something smells Something smells so bad Oh Mike make it stop And I realized I could smell it too Spoiled meat and swampgas Burst tissue and simmering guts Devore was the most alive of all of them generating the same crude but powerful magnetism I had felt around his greatgrandson but he was as dead as the rest of them too as he neared I could see the tiny bugs which were feeding in his nostrils and the pink corners of his eyes Everything down here is death I thought Didnt my own wife tell me so They reached out their tenebrous hands first to touch Ki and then to take her I backed up a step looked to my right and saw more ghosts  some coming out of busted windows some slipping from redbrick chimneys Holding Kyra in my arms I ran for the Ghost House Get him Jared Devore yelled startled Get him boys Get that punk Goddamnit I sprinted up the wooden steps vaguely aware of something soft rubbing against my cheek  Kis little stuffed dog still clutched in one of her hands I wanted to look back and see how close they were getting but I didnt dare If I stumbled  Hey the woman in the ticket booth cawed She had clouds of gingery hair makeup that appeared to have been applied with a gardentrowel and mercifully resembled no one I knew She was just a carny just passing through this benighted place Lucky her Hey mister you gotta buy a ticket No time lady no time Stop him Devore shouted Hes a goddam punk thief That aint his young un hes got Stop him But no one did and I rushed into the darkness of the Ghost House with Ki in my arms Beyond the entry was a passage so narrow I had to turn sideways to get down it Phosphorescent eyes glared at us in the gloom Up ahead was a growing wooden rumble a loose sound with a clacking chain beneath it Behind us came the clumsy thunder of caulkequipped loggers boots rushing up the stairs outside The gingerhaired carny was hollering at them now she was telling them that if they broke anything inside theyd have to give up the goods You mind me you damned rubes she shouted That place is for kids not the likes of you The rumble was directly ahead of us Something was turning At first I couldnt make out what it was Put me down Mike Kyra sounded excited I want to go through by myself I set her on her feet then looked nervously back over my shoulder The bright light at the entryway was blocked out as they tried to cram in You asses Devore yelled Not all at the same time Sweet weeping Jesus There was a smack and someone cried out I faced front just in time to see Kyra dart through the rolling barrel holding her hands out for balance Incredibly she was laughing I followed got halfway across then went down with a thump Ooops Kyra called from the far side then giggled as I tried to get up fell again and was tumbled all the way over The bandanna fell out of my bib pocket A bag of horehound candy dropped from another pocket I tried to look back to see if they had got themselves sorted out and were coming When I did the barrel hurled me through another inadvertent somersault Now I knew how clothes felt in a dryer I crawled to the end of the barrel got up took Kis hand and let her lead us deeper into the Ghost House We got perhaps ten paces before white bloomed around her like a lily and she screamed Some animal  something that sounded like a huge cat  hissed heavily Adrenaline dumped into my bloodstream and I was about to jerk her backward into my arms again when the hiss came once more I felt hot air on my ankles and Kis dress made that bellshape around her legs again This time she laughed instead of screaming Go Ki I whispered Fast We went on leaving the steamvent behind There was a mirrored corridor where we were reflected first as squat dwarves and then as scrawny ectomorphs with long white vampire features I had to urge Kyra on again she wanted to make faces at herself Behind us I heard cursing lumberjacks trying to negotiate the barrel I could hear Devore cursing too but he no longer seemed so    well so eminent There was a slidingpole that landed us on a big canvas pillow This made a loud farting noise when we hit it and Ki laughed until fresh tears spilled down her cheeks rolling around and kicking her feet in glee I got my hands under her arms and yanked her up Dont taggle yer own quartermack she said then laughed again Her fear seemed to have entirely departed We went down another narrow corridor It smelled of the fragrant pine from which it had been constructed Behind one of these walls two ghosts were clanking chains as mechanically as men working on a shoefactory assembly line talking about where they were going to take their girls tonight and who was going to bring some redeye engine whatever that was I could no longer hear anyone behind us Kyra led the way confidently one of her little hands holding one of my big ones pulling me along When we came to a door painted with glowing flames and marked THIS WAY TO HADES she pushed through it with no hesitation at all Here red isinglass topped the passage like a tinted skylight imparting a rosy glow I thought far too pleasant for Hades We went on for what felt like a very long time and I realized I could no longer hear the calliope the hearty bong of the Test Your Strength bell or Sara and the RedTops Nor was that exactly surprising We must have walked a quarter of a mile How could any county fair Ghost House be so big We came to three doors then one on the left one on the right and one set into the end of the corridor On one a little red tricycle was painted On the door facing it was my green IBM typewriter The picture on the door at the end looked older somehow  faded and dowdy It showed a childs sled Thats Scooter Larribees I thought Thats the one Devore stole A rash of gooseflesh broke out on my arms and back Well Kyra said brightly here are our toys She lifted Strickland presumably so he could see the red trike Yeah I said I guess so Thank you for taking me away she said Those were scary men but the spookyhouse was fun Nightynight Stricken says nightynight too It still came out sounding exotic  tiu  like the Vietnamese word for sublime happiness Before I could say another word she had pushed open the door with the trike on it and stepped through It snapped shut behind her and as it did I saw the ribbon from her hat It was hanging out of the bib pocket of the overalls I was wearing I looked at it a moment then tried the knob of the door she had just gone through It wouldnt turn and when I slapped my hand against the wood it was like slapping some hard and fabulously dense metal I stepped back then cocked my head in the direction from which wed come There was nothing Total silence This is the betweentime I thought When people talk about slipping through the cracks this is what they really mean This is the place where they really go You better get going yourself Jo told me If you dont want to find yourself trapped here maybe forever you better get going yourself I tried the knob of the door with the typewriter painted on it It turned easily Behind it was another narrow corridor  more wooden walls and the sweet smell of pine I didnt want to go in there something about it made me think of a long coffin but there was nothing else to do nowhere else to go I went and the door slammed shut behind me Christ I thought Im in the dark in a closedin place    its time for one of Michael Noonan s worldfamous panic attacks But no bands clamped themselves over my chest and although my heartrate was high and my muscles were still jacked on adrenaline I was under control Also I realized it wasnt entirely dark I could only see a little but enough to make out the walls and the plank floor I wrapped the dark blue ribbon from Kis hat around my wrist tucking one end underneath so it wouldnt come loose Then I began to move forward I went on for a long time the corridor turning this way and that seemingly at random I felt like a microbe slipping through an intestine At last I came to a pair of wooden arched doorways I stood before them wondering which was the correct choice and realized I could hear Bunters bell faintly through the one to my left I went that way and as I walked the bell grew steadily louder At some point the sound of the bell was joined by the mutter of thunder The autumn cool had left the air and it was hot again  stifling I looked down and saw that the biballs and clodhopper shoes were gone I was wearing thermal underwear and itchy socks Twice more I came to choices and each time I picked the opening through which I could hear Bunters bell As I stood before the second pair of doorways I heard a voice somewhere in the dark say quite clearly No the Presidents wife wasnt hit Thats his blood on her stockings I walked on then stopped when I realized my feet and ankles no longer itched that my thighs were no longer sweating into the longjohns I was wearing the Jockey shorts I usually slept in I looked up and saw I was in my own living room threading my way carefully around the furniture as you do in the dark trying like hell not to stub your stupid toe I could see a little better faint milky light was coming in through the windows I reached the counter which separates the living room from the kitchen and looked over it at the waggycat clock It was five past five I went to the sink and turned on the water When I reached for a glass I saw I was still wearing the ribbon from Kis straw hat on my wrist I unwound it and put it on the counter between the coffeemaker and the kitchen TV Then I drew myself some cold water drank it down and made my way cautiously along the northwing corridor by the pallid yellow glow of the bathroom nightlight I peed yourinated I could hear Ki saying then went into the bedroom The sheets were rumpled but the bed didnt have the orgiastic look of the morning after my dream of Sara Mattie and Jo Why would it Id gotten out of it and had myself a little sleepwalk An extraordinarily vivid dream of the Fryeburg Fair Except that was bullshit and not just because I had the blue silk ribbon from Kis hat None of it had the quality of dreams on waking where what seemed plausible becomes immediately ridiculous and all the colors  both those bright and those ominous  fade at once I raised my hands to my face cupped them over my nose and breathed deeply Pine When I looked I even saw a little smear of sap on one pinky finger I sat on the bed thought about dictating what Id just experienced into the MemoScriber then flopped back on the pillows instead I was too tired Thunder rumbled I closed my eyes began to drift away and then a scream ripped through the house It was as sharp as the neck of a broken bottle I sat up with a yell clutching at my chest It was Jo I had never heard her scream like that in our life together but I knew who it was just the same Stop hurting her I shouted into the darkness Whoever you are stop hurting her She screamed again as if something with a knife clamp or hot poker took a malicious delight in disobeying me It seemed to come from a distance this time and her third scream while just as agonized as the first two was farther away still They were diminishing as the little boys sobbing had diminished A fourth scream floated out of the dark then Sara was silent Breathless the house breathed around me Alive in the heat aware in the faint sound of dawn thunder I was finally able to get into the zone but couldnt do anything once I got there I keep a steno pad handy for notes character lists page references date chronologies  and I doodled in there a little bit but the sheet of paper in the IBM remained blank There was no thundering heartbeat no throbbing eyes or difficulty breathing  no panic attack in other words  but there was no story either Andy Drake John Shackleford Ray Garraty the beautiful Regina Whiting    they stood with their backs turned refusing to speak or move The manuscript was sitting in its accustomed place on the left side of the typewriter the pages held down with a pretty chunk of quartz Id found on the lane but nothing was happening Zilch I recognized an irony here perhaps even a moral For years I had fled the problems of the real world escaping into various Narnias of my imagination Now the real world had filled up with bewildering thickets there were things with teeth in some of them and the wardrobe was locked against me Kyra I had printed putting her name inside a scalloped shape that was supposed to be a cabbage rose Below it I had drawn a piece of bread with a beret tipped rakishly on the top crust Noonans conception of French toast The letters LB surrounded with curlicues A shirt with a rudimentary duck on it Beside this I had printed QUACK QUACK Below QUACK QUACK I had written Ought to fly away Bon Voyage At another spot on the sheet I had written Dean Auster and Devore They were the ones who had seemed the most there the most dangerous Because they had descendants But surely all seven of those jacks must mustnt they In those days most families were whoppers And where had I been I had asked but Devore hadnt wanted to say It didnt feel any more like a dream at ninethirty on a sullenly hot Sunday morning Which left exactly what Visions Timetravel And if there was a purpose to such travel what was it What was the message and who was trying to send it I remembered clearly what Id said just before passing from the dream in which I had sleepwalked out to Jos studio and brought back my typewriter I dont believe these lies Nor would I now Until I could see at least some of the truth it might be safer to believe nothing at all At the top of the sheet upon which I was doodling in heavily stroked letters I printed the word DANGER then circled it From the circle I drew an arrow to Kyras name From her name I drew an arrow to Ought to fly away Bon Voyage and added MATTIE Below the bread wearing the beret I drew a little telephone Above it I put a cartoon balloon with RRRINGG in it As I finished this the cordless phone rang It was sitting on the deck rail I circled MATTIE and picked up the phone Mike She sounded excited Happy Relieved Yeah I said How are you Great she said and I circled LB on my pad Lindy Briggs called ten minutes ago  I just got off the phone with her Mike shes giving me my job back Isnt that wonderful Sure And wonderful how it would keep her in town I crossed out Ought to fly away Bon Voyage knowing that Mattie wouldnt go Not now And how could I ask her to I thought again If only I knew a little more    Mike Are you   Its very wonderful I said In my minds eye I could see her standing in the kitchen drawing the kinked telephone cord through her fingers her legs long and coltish below her denim shorts I could see the shirt she was wearing a white tee with a yellow duck paddling across the front I hope Lindy had the good grace to sound ashamed of herself I circled the teeshirt Id drawn She did And she was frank enough to kind of    well disarm me She said the Whitmore woman talked to her early last week Was very frank and to the point Lindy said I was to be let go immediately If that happened the money computer equipment and software Devore funnelled into the library would keep coming If it didnt the flow of goods and money would stop immediately She said she had to balance the good of the community against what she knew was wrong    she said it was one of the toughest decisions she ever had to make     Uhhuh On the pad my hand moved of its own volition like a planchette gliding over a Ouija board printing the words PLEASE CANT I PLEASE Theres probably some truth in it but Mattie    how much do you suppose Lindy makes I dont know I bet its more than any three other smalltown librarians in the state of Maine combined In the background I heard Ki Can I talk Mattie Can I talk to Mike Please cant I please In a minute hon Then to me Maybe All I know is that I have my job back and Im willing to let bygones be bygones On the page I drew a book Then I drew a series of interlocked circles between it and the duck teeshirt Ki wants to talk to you Mattie said laughing She says the two of you went to the Fryeburg Fair last night Whoa you mean I had a date with a pretty girl and slept through it Seems that way Are you ready for her Ready Okay here comes the chatterbox There was a rustling as the phone changed hands then Ki was there I taggled you at the Fair Mike I taggled my own quartermack Did you I asked That was quite a dream wasnt it Ki There was a long silence at the other end I could imagine Mattie wondering what had happened to her telephone chatterbox At last Ki said in a hesitating voice You there too Tiu We saw the snakedance ladies    the pole with the bell on top    we went in the spookyhouse    you fell down in the barrel It wasnt a dream    was it I could have convinced her that it was but all at once that seemed like a bad idea one that was dangerous in its own way I said You had on a pretty hat and a pretty dress Yeah Ki sounded enormously relieved And you had on   Kyra stop Listen to me She stopped at once Its better if you dont talk about that dream too much I think To your mom or to anyone except me Except you Yes And the same with the refrigerator people Okay Okay Mike there was a lady in Matties clothes I know I said It was all right for her to talk I was sure of it but I asked anyway Wheres Mattie now Waterin the flowers We got lots of flowers a billion at least I have to clean up the table Its a chore I dont mind though I like chores We had French toast We always do on Sundays Its yummy specially with strawberry syrup I know I said drawing an arrow to the piece of bread wearing the beret French toast is great Ki did you tell your mom about the lady in her dress No I thought it might scare her She dropped her voice Here she comes Thats all right    but weve got a secret right Yes Now can I talk to Mattie again Okay Her voice moved off a little Mommybommy Mike wants to talk to you Then she came back Will you bizzit us today We could go on another picnic I cant today Ki I have to work Mattie never works on Sunday Well when Im writing a book I write every day I have to or else Ill forget the story Maybe well have a picnic on Tuesday though A barbecue picnic at your house Is it long til Tuesday Not too long Day after tomorrow Is it long to write a book Mediumlong I could hear Mattie telling Ki to give her the phone I will just one more second Mike Im here Ki I love you I was both touched and terrified For a moment I was sure my throat was going to lock up the way my chest used to when I tried to write Then it cleared and I said Love you too Ki Heres Mattie Again there was the rustly sound of the telephone changing hands then Mattie said Did that refresh your recollection of your date with my daughter sir Well I said it certainly refreshed hers There was a link between Mattie and me but it didnt extend to this  I was sure of it She was laughing I loved the way she sounded this morning and I didnt want to bring her down    but I didnt want her mistaking the white line in the middle of the road for the crossmock either Mattie you still need to be careful okay Just because Lindy Briggs offered you your old job back doesnt mean everyone in town is suddenly your friend I understand that she said I thought again about asking if shed consider taking Ki up to Derry for awhile  they could live in my house stay for the duration of the summer if that was what it took for things to return to normal down here Except she wouldnt do it When it came to accepting my offer of highpriced New York legal talent shed had no choice About this she did Or thought she did and how could I change her mind I had no logic no connected facts all I had was a vague dark shape like something lying beneath nine inches of snowblind ice I want you to be careful of two men in particular I said One is Bill Dean The other is Kenny Auster Hes the one     with the big dog who wears the neckerchief He   Thats Booberry Ki called from the middle distance Booberry licked my facie Go out and play hon Mattie said Im clearun the table You can finish later Go on outside now There was a pause as she watched Ki go out the door taking Strickland with her Although the kid had left the trailer Mattie still spoke in the lowered tone of someone who doesnt want to be overheard Are you trying to scare me No I said drawing repeated circles around the word DANGER But I want you to be careful Bill and Kenny may have been on Devores team like Footman and Osgood Dont ask me why I think that might be because I have no satisfactory answer Its only a feeling but since I got back on the TR my feelings are different What do you mean Are you wearing a teeshirt with a duck on it How do you know that Did Ki tell you Did she take the little stuffed dog from her Happy Meal out with her just now A long pause At last she said My God in a voice so Low I could hardly hear it Then again How   I dont know how I dont know if youre still in a    a bad situation either or why you might be but I feel that you are That you both are I could have said more but I was afraid shed think Id gone entirely off the rails Hes dead she burst out That old man is dead Why cant he leave us alone Maybe he has Maybe Im wrong about all this But theres no harm in being careful is there No she said Usually thats true Usually Why dont you come and see me Mike Maybe we could go to the Fair together Maybe this fall we will All three of us Id like that In the meantime Im thinking about the key Thinking is half your problem Mike she said and laughed again Ruefully I thought And I saw what she meant What she didnt seem to understand was that feeling was the other half Its a sling and in the end I think it rocks most of us to death I worked for a while then carried the IBM back into the house and left the manuscript on top I was done with it at least for the time being No more looking for the way back through the wardrobe no more Andy Drake and John Shackleford until this was over And as I dressed in long pants and a buttonup shirt for the first time in what felt like weeks it occurred to me that perhaps something  some force  had been trying to sedate me with the story I was telling With the ability to work again It made sense work had always been my drug of choice even better than booze or the Mellaril I still kept in the bathroom medicine cabinet Or maybe work was only the delivery system the hypo with all the dreamy dreams inside it Maybe the real drug was the zone Being in the zone Feeling it you sometimes hear the basketball players say I was in the zone and I was really feeling it I grabbed the keys to the Chevrolet off the counter and looked at the fridge as I did The magnets were circled again In the middle was a message Id seen before one that was now instantly understandable thanks to the extra Magnabet letters help her Im doing my best I said and went out Three miles north on Route   by then youre on the part of it which used to be known as Castle Rock Roadtheres a greenhouse with a shop in front of it Slips n Greens its called and Jo used to spend a fair amount of time there buying gardening supplies or just noodling with the two women who ran the place One of them was Helen Auster Kennys wife I pulled in there at around ten oclock that Sunday morning it was open of course during tourist season almost every Maine shopkeeper turns heathen and parked next to a Beamer with New York plates I paused long enough to hear the weather forecast on the radio  continued hot and humid for another fortyeight hours at least  and then got out A woman wearing a bathing suit a skort and a giant yellow sunhat emerged from the shop with a bag of peat moss cradled in her arms She gave me a little smile I returned it with eighteen per cent interest She was from New York and that meant she wasnt a Martian The shop was even hotter and damper than the white morning outside Lila Proulx the coowner was on the phone There was a little fan beside the cash register and she was standing directly in front of it flapping the front of her sleeveless blouse She saw me and twiddled her fingers in a wave I twiddled mine back feeling like someone else Work or no work I was still zoning Still feeling it I walked around the shop picking up a few things almost at random watching Lila out of the corner of my eye and waiting for her to get off the phone so I could talk to her    and all the time my own private hyperdrive was humming softly away At last she hung up and I came to the counter Michael Noonan what a sight for sore eyes you are she said and began ringing up my purchases I was awfully sorry to hear about Johanna Got to get that right up front Jo was a pet Thanks Lila Welcome Dont need to say any more about it but with a thing like that its best to put it right up front Ive always believed it always will believe it Right up front Going to do a little gardening are you Gointer do a little gaadnin aaa you If it ever cools off Ayuh Isnt it wicked She flapped the top of her blouse again to show me how wicked it was then pointed at one of my purchases Want this one in a special bag Always safe never sorry thats my motto I nodded then looked at the little blackboard tilted against the counter FRESH BLUBERRYS the chalked message read THE CROPS IS IN Ill have a pint of berries too I said As long as theyre not Fridays I can do better than Friday She nodded vigorously as if to say she knew damned well I could These were on the bush yesty That fresh enough for you Good as gold I said Blueberrys the name of Kennys dog isnt it Aint he a funny one God I love a big dog if hes behaved She turned got a pint of berries from her little fridge and put them in another bag for me Wheres Helen I asked Day off Not her Lila said If shes in town you cant get her out of this place less you beat her with a stick She and Kenny and the kids went down Taxachusetts Them and her brothers family club together and get a seaside cottage two weeks every summer They all went Old Blueberry hell chase seagulls until he drops She laughed  it was a loud and hearty one It made me think of Sara Tidwell Or maybe it was the way Lila looked at me as she did it There was no laughter in her eyes They were small and considering coldly curious Would you for Christs sake quit it I told myself They cant all be in on it together Mike Couldnt they though There is such a thing as town consciousness  anyone who doubts it has never been to a New England town meeting Where theres a consciousness is there not likely to be a subconscious And if Kyra and I were doing the old mindmeld thing could not other people in TR also be doing it perhaps without even knowing it We all shared the same air and land we shared the lake and the aquifer which lay below everything buried water tasting of rock and minerals We shared The Street as well that place where good pups and vile dogs could walk sidebyside As I started out with my purchases in a cloth carryhandle bag Lila said What a shame about Royce Merrill Did you hear No I said Fell down his cellar stairs yesty evening What a man his age was doing going down such a steep flight of steps is beyond me but I suppose once you get to his age you have your own reasons for doing things Is he dead I started to ask then rephrased It wasnt the way the question was expressed on the TR Did he pass Not yet Motton Rescue took him to Castle County General Hes in a coma Comber she said it They dont think hell ever wake up poor fella Theres a piece of history thatll die with him I suppose thats true Good riddance I thought Does he have children No There have been Merrills on the TR for two hundred years one died at Cemetery Ridge But all the old families are dying out now You have a nice day Mike She smiled Her eyes remained flat and considering I got into my Chevy put the bag with my purchases in it on the passenger seat then simply sat for a moment letting the air conditioner pour cool air on my face and neck Kenny Auster was in Taxachusetts That was good A step in the right direction But there was still my caretaker Bills not here Yvette said She stood in the door blocking it as well as she could you can only do so much in that regard when youre fivethree and weigh roughly a hundred pounds studying me with the gimlet gaze of a nightclub bouncer denying reentry to a drunk whos been tossed out on his ear once already I was on the porch of the neataseveryousaw Cape Cod which stands at the top of Peabody Hill and looks all the way across New Hampshire and into Vermonts back yard Bills equipment sheds were lined up to the left of the house all of them painted the same shade of gray each with its own sign DEAN CARETAKING No  No  and No  Parked in front of No  was Bills Dodge Ram I looked at it then back at Yvette Her lips tightened a little more Another notch and I figured theyd be gone entirely He went to North Conway with Butch Wiggins she said They went in Butchs truck To get   No need lying for me dear heart Bill said from behind her It was still over an hour shy of noon and on the Lords Day to boot but I had never heard a man who sounded more tired He clumped down the hall and as he came out of its shadows and into the light  the sun was finally burning through the murk  I saw that Bill now looked his age Every year of it and maybe ten more to grow on He was wearing his usual khaki shirt and pants  Bill Dean would be a Dickies man until the day he died  but his shoulders looked slumped almost sprained as if hed spent a week lugging buckets that were too heavy for him The fallingaway of his face had finally begun an indefinable something that makes the eyes look too big the jaw too prominent the mouth a bit loose He looked old There were no children to carry on the family line of work either all the old families were dying out Lila Proulx had said And maybe that was a good thing Bill   she began but he raised one of his big hands to stop her The callused fingertips shook a little Go in the kitchen a dight he told her I need to talk to my compadre here Twont take long Yvette looked at him and when she looked back at me she had indeed reached zero lipsurface There was just a black line where they had been like a mark dashed off with a pencil I saw with woeful clarity that she hated me Dont you tire him out she said to me He hasnt been sleepin Its the heat She walked back down the hall all stiff back and high shoulders disappearing into shadows that were probably cool It always seems to be cool in the houses of old people have you noticed Bill came out onto the porch and put his big hands into the pockets of his pants without offering to shake with me I aint got nothin to say to you You and mes quits Why Bill Why are we quits He looked west where the hills stepped into the burning summer haze disappearing in it before they could become mountains and said nothing Im trying to help that young woman He gave me a look from the corners of his eyes that I could read well enough Ahuh Help yself right into her pants I see men come up from New York and New Jersey with their young girls Summer weekends ski weekends it dont matter Men who go with girls that age always look the same got their tongues run out even when their mouths are shut Now you look the same I felt both angry and embarrassed but I resisted the urge to chase him in that direction That was what he wanted What happened here I asked him What did your fathers and grandfathers and greatgrandfathers do to Sara Tidwell and her family You didnt just move them on did you Didnt have to Bill said looking past me at the hills His eyes were moist almost to the point of tears but his jaw was set and hard They moved on themselves Never was a nigger who didnt have an itchy foot my dad used to say Who set the trap that killed Son Tidwells boy Was it your father Bill Was it Fred His eyes moved his jaw never did I dunno what youre talking about I hear him crying in my house Do you know what its like to hear a dead child crying in your house Some bastard trapped him like a weasel and I hear him crying in my fucking house Youre going to need a new caretaker Bill said I cant do for you no more Dont want to What I want is for you to get off my porch Whats happening Help me for Christs sake Ill help you with the toe of my shoe if you dont get going on your own I looked at him a moment longer taking in the wet eyes and the set jaw his divided nature written on his face I lost my wife you old bastard I said A woman you claimed to love Now his jaw moved at last He looked at me with surprise and injury That didnt happen here he said That didnt have anything to do with here She mightve been off the TR because    well she mightve had her reasons to be off the TR    but she just had a stroke Would have happened anywhere Anywhere I dont believe that I dont think you do either Something followed her to Derry maybe because she was pregnant     Bills eyes widened I gave him a chance to say something but he didnt take it     or maybe just because she knew too much She had a stroke Bills voice wasnt quite even I read the obituary myself She had a damn stroke What did she find out Talk to me Bill Please There was a long pause Until it was over I allowed myself the luxury of thinking I might actually be getting through to him Ive only got one more thing to say to you Mike  stand back For the sake of your immortal soul stand back and let things run their course They will whether you do or dont This river has almost come to the sea it wont be dammed by the likes of you Stand back For the love of Christ Do you care about your soul Mr Noonan Gods butterfly caught in a cocoon of flesh that will soon stink like mine Bill turned and walked to his door the heels of his workboots clodding on the painted boards Stay away from Mattie and Ki I said If you so much as go near that trailer   He turned back and the hazy sunshine glinted on the tracks below his eyes He took a bandanna from his back pocket and wiped his cheeks I aint stirrin from this house I wish to God Id never come back from my vacation in the first place but I did  mostly on your account Mike Those two down on Wasp Hill have nothing to fear from me No not from me He went inside and closed the door I stood there looking at it feeling unreal  surely I could not have had such a deadly conversation with Bill Dean could I Bill who had reproached me for not letting folks down here share  and perhaps ease  my grief for Jo Bill who had welcomed me back so warmly Then I heard a clack sound He might not have locked his door while he was at home in his entire life but he had locked it now The clack was very clear in the breathless July air It told me everything I had to know about my long friendship with Bill Dean I turned and walked back to my car my head down Nor did I turn when I heard a window run up behind me Dont you ever come back here you town bastard Yvette Dean cried across the sweltering dooryard Youve broken his heart Dont you ever come back Dont you ever Dont you ever Please Mrs M said Dont ask me any more questions Mike I cant afford to get in Bill Deans bad books any moren my ma could afford to get into Normal Austers or Fred Deans I shifted the phone to my other ear All I want to know is   In this part of the world caretakers pretty well run the whole show If they say to a summer fella that he should hire this carpenter or that lectrician why thats who the summer fella hires Or if a caretaker says this one should be fired because he aint proving reliable he is fired Or she Because what goes once for plumbers and landscapers and lectricians has always gone twice for housekeepers If you want to be recommended  and stay recommended  you have to keep on the sunny side of people like Fred and Bill Dean or Normal and Kenny Auster Dont you see She was almost pleading When Bill found out I told you about what Normal Auster did to Kerry oooo he was so mad at me Kenny Austers brother  the one Normal drowned under the pump  his name was Kerry Ahuh Ive known a lot of folks name their kids alike think its cute Why I went to school with a brother and sister named Roland and Rolanda Therriault I think Rolands in Manchester now and Rolanda married that boy from   Brenda just answer one question Ill never tell Please I waited my breath held for the click that would come when she put her telephone back in its cradle Instead she spoke three words in a soft almost regretful voice What is it Who was Carla Dean I waited through another long pause my hand playing with the ribbon that had come off Kis turnofthecentury straw hat You dassnt tell anyone I told you anything she said at last I wont Carla was Bills twin sister She died sixtyfive years ago during the time of the fires The fires Bill claimed had been set by Kis grandfather  his goingaway present to the TR I dont know just how it happened Bill never talks about it If you tell him I told you Ill never make another bed in the TR Hell see to it Then in a hopeless voice she said He may know anyway Based on my own experiences and surmises I guessed she might be right about that But even if she was shed have a check from me every month for the rest of her working life I had no intention of telling her that over the telephone though  it would scald her Yankee soul Instead I thanked her assured her again of my discretion and hung up I sat at the table for a moment staring blankly at Bunter then said Whos here No answer Come on I said Dont be shy Lets go nineteen or ninetytwo down Barring that lets talk Still no answer Not so much as a shiver of the bell around the stuffed mooses neck I spied the scribble of notes Id made while talking to Jos brother and drew them toward me I had put Kia Kyra Kito and Carla in a box Now I scribbled out the bottom line of that box and added the name Kerry to the list Ive known a lot of folks name their kids alike Mrs M had said They think its cute I didnt think it was cute I thought it was creepy It occurred to me that at least two of these soundalikes had drowned  Kerry Auster under a pump Kia Noonan in her mothers dying body when she wasnt much bigger than a sunflower seed And I had seen the ghost of a third drowned child in the lake Kito Was that one Kito Or was Kito the one who had died of bloodpoisoning They name their kids alike they think its cute How many soundalike kids had there been to start with How many were left I thought the answer to the first question didnt matter and that I knew the answer to the second one already This river has almost come to the sea Bill had said Carla Kerry Kito Kia    all gone Only Kyra Devore was left I got up so fast and hard that I knocked over my chair The clatter in the silence made me cry out I was leaving and right now No more telephone calls no more playing Andy Drake Private Detective no more depositions or halfassed wooings of the lady fair I should have followed my instincts and gotten the fuck out of Dodge that first night Well Id go now just get in the Chevy and haul ass for Der  Bunters bell jangled furiously I turned and saw it bouncing around his neck as if batted to and fro by a hand I couldnt see The sliding door giving on the deck began to fly open and clap shut like something hooked to a pulley The book of Tough Stuff crossword puzzles on the endtable and the DSS program guide blew open their pages riffling There was a series of rattling thuds across the floor as if something enormous were crawling rapidly toward me pounding its fists as it came A draft  not cold but warm like the rush of air produced by a subway train on a summer night  buffeted past me In it I heard a strange voice which seemed to be saying ByeBY byeBY byeBY as if wishing me a good trip home Then as it dawned on me that the voice was actually saying KiKi KiKi KiKi something struck me and knocked me violently forward It felt like a large soft fist I buckled over the table clawing at it to stay up overturning the lazy susan with the salt and pepper shakers on it the napkin holder the little vase Mrs M had filled with daisies The vase rolled off the table and shattered The kitchen TV blared on some politician talking about how inflation was on the march again The CD player started up drowning out the politician it was the Rolling Stones doing a cover of Sara Tidwells I Regret You Baby Upstairs one smoke alarm went off then another then a third They were joined a moment later by the warblewhoop of the Chevys car alarm The whole world was cacophony Something hot and pillowy seized my wrist My hand shot forward like a piston and slammed down on the steno pad I watched as it pawed clumsily to a blank page then seized the pencil which lay nearby I gripped it like a dagger and then something wrote with it not guiding my hand but raping it The hand moved slowly at first almost blindly then picked up speed until it was flying almost tearing through the sheet I had almost reached the bottom of the page when the cold descended again that outer cold that was like sleet in January chilling my skin and crackling the snot in my nose and sending two shuddery puffs of white air from my mouth My hand clenched and the pencil snapped in two Behind me Bunters bell rang out one final furious convulsion before falling silent Also from behind me came a peculiar double pop like the sound of champagne corks being drawn Then it was over Whatever it had been or however many they had been it was finished I was alone again I turned off the CD player just as Mick and Keith moved on to a whiteboy version of Howling Wolf then ran upstairs and pushed the reset buttons on the smokedetectors I leaned out the window of the big guest bedroom while I was up there aimed the fob of my keyring down at the Chevrolet and pushed the button on it The alarm quit With the worst of the noise gone I could hear the TV cackling away in the kitchen I went down killed it then froze with my hand still on the OFF button looking at Jos annoying waggycat clock Its tail had finally stopped switching and its big plastic eyes lay on the floor They had popped right out of its head I went down to the Village Cafe for supper snagging the last Sunday Telegram from the rack COMPUTER MOGUL DEVORE DIES IN WESTERN MAINE TOWN WHERE HE GREW UP the headline read before sitting down at the counter The accompanying photo was a studio shot of Devore that looked about thirty years old He was smiling Most people do that quite naturally On Devores face it looked like a learned skill I ordered the beans that were left over from Buddy Jellisons Saturdaynight beanhole supper My father wasnt much for aphorisms  in my family dispensing nuggets of wisdom was Moms job  but as Daddy warmed up the Saturdaynight yelloweyes in the oven on Sunday afternoon he would invariably say that beans and beef stew were better the second day I guess it stuck The only other piece of fatherly wisdom I can remember receiving was that you should always wash your hands after you took a shit in a bus station While I was reading the story on Devore Audrey came over and told me that Royce Merrill had passed without recovering consciousness The funeral would be Tuesday afternoon at Grace Baptist she said Most of the town would be there many folks just to see Ila Meserve awarded the Boston Post cane Did I think Id get over No I said probably not I thought it prudent not to add that Id likely be attending a victory party at Mattie Devores while Royces funeral was going on down the road The usual lateSundayafternoon flow of customers came and went while I ate people ordering burgers people ordering beans people ordering chicken salad sandwiches people buying sixpacks Some were from the TR some from away I didnt notice many of them and no one spoke to me I have no idea who left the napkin on my newspaper but when I put down the A section and turned to find the sports there it was I picked it up meaning only to put it aside and saw what was written on the back in big dark letters GET OFF THE TR I never found out who left it there I guess it could have been any of them The murk came back and transformed that Sunday nights dusk into a thing of decadent beauty The sun turned red as it slid down toward the hills and the haze picked up the glow turning the western sky into a nosebleed I sat out on the deck and watched it trying to do a crossword puzzle and not getting very far When the phone rang I dropped Tough Stuff on top of my manuscript as I went to answer it I was tired of looking at the title of my book every time I passed Hello Whats going on up there John Storrow demanded He didnt even bother to say hi He didnt sound angry though he sounded totally pumped Im missing the whole goddam soap opera I invited myself to lunch on Tuesday I said Hope you dont mind No thats good the more the merrier He sounded as if he absolutely meant it What a summer huh What a summer Anything happen just lately Earthquakes Volcanoes Mass suicides No mass suicides but the old guy died I said Shit the whole world knows Max Devore kicked it he said Surprise me Mike Stun me Make me holler boyhowdy No the other old guy Royce Merrill I dont know who you oh wait The one with the gold cane who looked like an exhibit from Jurassic Park Thats him Bummer Otherwise     Otherwise everythings under control I said then thought of the poppedout eyes of the catclock and almost laughed What stopped me was a kind of surety that Mr Good Humor Man was just an act  John had really called to ask what if anything was going on between me and Mattie And what was I going to say Nothing yet One kiss one instant bluesteel hardon the fundamental things apply as time goes by But John had other things on his mind Listen Michael I called because Ive got something to tell you I think youll be both amused and amazed A state we all crave I said Lay it on me Rogette Whitmore called and    you didnt happen to give her my parents number did you Im back in New York now but she called me in Philly I didnt have your parents number You didnt leave it on either of your machines Oh right No apology he seemed too excited to think of such mundanities I began to feel excited myself and I didnt even know what the hell was going on I gave it to Mattie Do you think the Whitmore woman called Mattie to get it Would Mattie give it to her Im not sure that if Mattie came upon Rogette flaming in a thoroughfare shed piss on her to put her out Vulgar Michael trs vulgarino But he was laughing Maybe Whitmore got it the same way Devore got yours Probably so I said I dont know whatll happen in the months ahead but right now Im sure shes still got access to Max Devores personal control panel And if anyone knows how to push the buttons on it its probably her Did she call from Palm Springs Uhhuh She said shed just finished a preliminary meeting with Devores attorneys concerning the old mans will According to her Grampa left Mattie Devore eighty million dollars I was struck silent I wasnt amused yet but I was certainly amazed Gets ya dont it John said gleefully You mean he left it to Kyra I said at last Left it in trust to Kyra No thats just what he did not do I asked Whitmore three times but by the third I was starting to understand There was method in his madness Not much but a little You see theres a condition If he left the money to the minor child instead of to the mother the condition would have no weight Its funny when you consider that Mattie isnt long past minor status herself Funny I agreed and thought of her dress sliding between my hands and her smooth bare waist I also thought of Bill Dean saying that men who went with girls that age always looked the same had their tongues run out even if their mouths were shut What string did he put on the money That Mattie remain on the TR for one year following Devores death  until July   She can leave on daytrips but she has to be tucked up in her TR bed every night by nine oclock or else the legacy is forfeit Did you ever hear such a bullshit thing in your life Outside of some old George Sanders movie that is No I said and recalled my visit to the Fryeburg Fair with Kyra Even in death hes seeking custody I had thought and of course this was the same thing He wanted them here Even in death he wanted them on the TR It wont fly I asked Of course it wont fly Fucking crackpot might as well have written hed give her eighty million dollars if she used blue tampons for a year But shell get the eighty mil all right My heart is set on it Ive already talked to three of our estate guys and    you dont think I should bring one of them up with me on Tuesday do you Will Stevensonll be the point man in the estate phase if Mattie agrees He was all but babbling He hadnt had a thing to drink Idve bet the farm on it but he was skyhigh on all the possibilities Wed gotten to the happilyeverafter part of the fairy tale as far as he was concerned Cinderella comes home from the ball through a cash cloudburst     course Wills a little bit old John was saying about three hundred or so which means hes not exactly a fun guy at a party but     Leave him home why dont you I said Therell be plenty of time to carve up Devores will later on And in the immediate future I dont think Matties going to have any problem observing the bullshit condition She just got her job back remember Yeah the white buffalo drops dead and the whole herd scatters John exulted Look at em go And the new multimillionaire goes back to filing books and mailing out overdue notices Okay Tuesday well just party Good Party til we puke Well    maybe us older folks will just party until were mildly nauseated would that be all right Sure Ive already called Romeo Bissonette and hes going to bring George Kennedy the private detective who got all that hilarious shit on Durgin Bissonette says Kennedys a scream when he gets a drink or two in him I thought Id bring some steaks from Peter Lugers did I tell you that I dont believe you did Best steaks in the world Michael do you realize whats happened to that young woman Eighty million dollars Shell be able to replace Scoutie Huh Nothing Will you come in tomorrow night or on Tuesday Tuesday morning around ten into Castle County Airport New England Air Mike are you all right You sound odd Im all right Im where Im supposed to be I think Whats that supposed to mean I had wandered out onto the deck In the distance thunder rumbled It was hotter than hell not a breath of breeze stirring The sunset was fading to a baleful afterglow The sky in the west looked like the white of a bloodshot eye I dont know I said but I have an idea the situation will clarify itself Ill meet you at the airport Okay he said and then in a hushed almost reverential voice Eighty million motherfucking American dollars Its a whole lotta lettuce I agreed and wished him a good night I drank black coffee and ate toast in the kitchen the next morning watching the TV weatherman Like so many of them these days he had a slightly mad look as if all those Doppler radar images had driven him to the brink of something I think of it as the Millennial Video Game look Weve got another thirtysix hours of this soup to work through and then theres going to be a big change he was saying and pointed to some dark gray scum lurking in the Midwest Tiny animated lightningbolts danced in it like defective sparkplugs Beyond the scum and the lightningbolts America looked clear all the way out to the desert country and the posted temperatures were fifteen degrees cooler Well see temps in the midnineties today and cant look for much relief tonight or tomorrow morning But tomorrow afternoon these frontal storms will reach western Maine and I think most of you are going to want to keep updated on weather conditions Before we get back to cooler air and bright clear skies on Wednesday were probably going to see violent thunderstorms heavy rain hail in some locations Tornados are rare in Maine but some towns in western and central Maine could see them tomorrow Back to you Earl Earl the morning news guy had the innocent beefy look of a recent retiree from the Chippendales and read off the Teleprompter like one Wow he said Thats quite a forecast Vince Tornados a possibility Wow I said Say wow again Earl Do it til Im satisfied Holy cow Earl said just to spite me and the telephone rang I went to answer it giving the waggy clock a look as I went by The night had been quiet  no sobbing no screaming no nocturnal adventures  but the clock was disquieting just the same It hung there On the wall eyeless and dead like a message full of bad news Hello Mr Noonan I knew the voice but for a moment couldnt place it It was because she had called me Mr Noonan To Brenda Meserve Id been Mike for almost fifteen years Mrs M Brenda What   I cant work for you anymore she said all in a rush Im sorry I cant give you proper notice  I never stopped work for anyone without giving notice not even that old drunk Mr Croyden  but I have to Please understand Did Bill find out I called you I swear to God Brenda I never said a word   No I havent spoken to him nor he to me I just cant come back to Sara Laughs I had a bad dream last night A terrible dream I dreamed that    somethings mad at me If I come back I could have an accident It would look like an accident at least but    it wouldnt be Thats silly Mrs M I wanted to say Youre surely past the age where you believe in campfire stories about ghoulies and ghosties and longleggedy beasties But of course I could say no such thing What was going on in my house was no campfire story I knew it and she knew I did Brenda if Ive caused you any trouble Im truly sorry Go away Mr Noonan    Mike Go back to Derry and stay for awhile Its the best thing you could do I heard the letters sliding on the fridge and turned This time I actually saw the circle of fruits and vegetables form It stayed open at the top long enough for four letters to slide inside Then a little plastic lemon plugged the hole and completed the circle yats the letters said then swapped themselves around making stay Then both the circle and the letters broke up Mike please Mrs M was crying Royces funeral is tomorrow Everyone in the TR who matters  the oldtimers  will be there Yes of course they would The old ones the bags of bones who knew what they knew and kept it to themselves Except some of them had talked to my wife Royce himself had talked to her Now he was dead So was she It would be best if you were gone You could take that young woman with you maybe Her and her little girl But could I I somehow didnt think so I thought the three of us were on the TR until this was over    and I was starting to have an idea of when that would be A storm was coming A summer storm Maybe even a tornado Brenda thanks for calling me And Im not letting you go Lets just call it a leave of absence shall we Fine    whatever you want Will you at least think about what I said Yes In the meantime I dont think Id tell anyone you called me all right No she said sounding shocked Then But theyll know Bill and Yvette    Dickie Brooks at the garage    old Anthony Weyland and Buddy Jellison and all the others    theyll know Goodbye Mr Noonan Im so sorry For you and your wife Your poor wife Im so sorry Then she was gone I held the phone in my hand for a long time Then like a man in a dream I put it down crossed the room and took the eyeless clock off the wall I threw it in the trash and went down to the lake for a swim remembering that W E Harvey story August Heat the one that ends with the line The heat is enough to drive a man mad Im not a bad swimmer when people arent pelting me with rocks but my first shoretofloattoshore lap was tentative and unrhythmic  ugly  because I kept expecting something to reach up from the bottom and grab me The drowned boy maybe The second lap was better and by the third I was relishing the increased kick of my heart and the silky coolness of the water rushing past me Halfway through the fourth lap I pulled myself up the floats ladder and collapsed on the boards feeling better than I had since my encounter with Devore and Rogette Whitmore on Friday night I was still in the zone and on top of that I was experiencing a glorious endorphin rush In that state even the dismay Id felt when Mrs M told me she was resigning her position ebbed away She would come back when this was over of course she would In the meantime it was probably best she stay away Somethings mad at me I could have an accident Yes indeed She might cut herself She might fall down a flight of cellar stairs She might even have a stroke running across a hot parking lot I sat up and looked at Sara on her hill the deck jutting out over the drop the railroad ties descending Id only been out of the water for a few minutes but already the days sticky heat was folding over me stealing my rush The water was still as a mirror I could see the house reflected in it and in the reflection Saras windows became watchful eyes I thought that the focus of all the phenomena  the epicenter  was very likely on The Street between the real Sara and its drowned image This is where it happened Devore had said And the oldtimers Most of them probably knew what I knew that Royce Merrill had been murdered And wasnt it possible  wasnt it likely  that what had killed him might come among them as they sat in their pews or gathered afterward around his grave That it might steal some of their force  their guilt their memories their TRness  to help it finish the job I was very glad that John was going to be at the trailer tomorrow and Romeo Bissonette and George Kennedy who was so amusing when he got a drink or two in him Glad it was going to be more than just me with Mattie and Ki when the old folks got together to give Royce Merrill his sendoff I no longer cared very much about what had happened to Sara and the RedTops or even about what was haunting my house What I wanted was to get through tomorrow and for Mattie and Ki to get through tomorrow Wed eat before the rain started and then let the predicted thunderstorms come I thought that if we could ride them out our lives and futures might clarify with the weather Is that right I asked I expected no answer  talking out loud was a habit I had picked up since returning here  but somewhere in the woods east of the house an owl hooted Just once as if to say it was right get through tomorrow and things will clarify The hoot almost brought something else to mind some association that was ultimately too gauzy to grasp I tried once or twice but the only thing I could come up with was the title of a wonderful old novel I Heard the Owl Call My Name I rolled forward off the float and into the water grasping my knees against my chest like a kid doing a cannonball I stayed under as long as I could until the air in my lungs started to feel like some hot bottled liquid and then I broke the surface I trod water about thirty yards out until I had my breath back then set my sights on the Green Lady and stroked for shore I waded out started up the railroad ties then stopped and went back to The Street I stood there for a moment gathering my courage then walked to where the birch curved her graceful belly out over the water I grasped that white curve as I had on Friday evening and looked into the water I was sure Id see the child his dead eyes looking up at me from his bloating brown face and that my mouth and throat would once more fill with the taste of the lake help Im drown lemme up oh sweet Jesus lemme up But there was nothing No dead boy no ribbonwrapped Boston Post cane no taste of the lake in my mouth I turned and peered at the gray forehead of rock poking out of the mulch I thought There right there but it was only a conscious and unspontaneous thought the mind voicing a memory The smell of decay and the certainty that something awful had happened right there was gone When I got back up to the house and went for a soda I discovered the front of the refrigerator was bare and clean Every magnetic letter every fruit and vegetable was gone I never found them I might have probably would have if there had been more time but on that Monday morning time was almost up I dressed then called Mattie We talked about the upcoming party about how excited Ki was about how nervous Mattie was about going back to work on Friday  she was afraid that the locals would be mean to her but in an odd womanly way she was even more afraid that they would be cold to her snub her We talked about the money and I quickly ascertained that she didnt believe in the reality of it Lance used to say his father was the kind of man whod show a piece of meat to a starving dog and then eat it himself she said But as long as I have my job back I wont starve and neither will Ki But if there really are big bucks     Oh gimmegimmegimme she said laughing What do you think I am crazy Nah By the way whats going on with Kis fridgeafator people Are they writing any new stuff That is the weirdest thing she said Theyre gone The fridgeafator people I dont know about them but the magnetic letters you gave her sure are When I asked Ki what she did with them she started crying and said Allamagoosalum took them She said he ate them in the middle of the night while everyone was sleeping for a snack Allamawhosalum Allamagoosalum Mattie said sounding wearily amused Another little legacy from her grandfather Its a corruption of the Micmac word for boogeyman or demon  I looked it up at the library Kyra had a good many nightmares about demons and wendigos and the allamagoosalum late last winter and this spring What a sweet old grandpa he was I said sentimentally Right a real pip She was miserable over losing the letters I barely got her calmed down before her ride to VBS came Ki wants to know if youll come to Final Exercises on Friday afternoon by the way She and her friend Billy Turgeon are going to flannelboard the story of baby Moses I wouldnt miss it I said    but of course I did We all did Any idea where her letters might have gone Mike No Yours are still okay Mine are fine but of course mine dont spell anything I said looking at the empty door of my own fridgeafator There was sweat on my forehead I could feel it creeping down into my eyebrows like oil Did you    I dont know    sense anything You mean did I maybe hear the evil alphabetthief as he slid through the window You know what I mean I suppose so A pause I thought I heard something in the night okay About three this morning actually I got up and went into the hall Nothing was there But    you know how hot its been lately Yes Well not in my trailer not last night It was cold as ice I swear I could almost see my breath I believed her After all I had seen mine Were the letters on the front of the fridge then I dont know I didnt go up the hall far enough to see into the kitchen I took one look around and then went back to bed I almost ran back to bed Sometimes bed feels safer you know She laughed nervously Its a kid thing Covers are boogeyman kryptonite Only at first when I got in    I dont know    I thought someone was in there already Like someone had been hiding on the floor underneath and then    when I went to check the hall    they got in Not a nice someone either Give me my dustcatcher I thought and shuddered What Mattie asked sharply What did you say I asked who did you think it was What was the first name that came into your mind Devore she said Him But there was no one there A pause I wish youd been there I do too Im glad Mike do you have any ideas at all about this Because its very freaky I think maybe     For a moment I was on the verge of telling her what had happened to my own letters But if I started talking where would it stop And how much could she be expected to believe     maybe Ki took the letters herself Went walking in her sleep and chucked them under the trailer or something Do you think that could be I think I like the idea of Kyra strolling around in her sleep even less than the idea of ghosts with cold breath taking the letters off the fridge Mattie said Take her to bed with you tonight I said and felt her thought come back like an arrow Id rather take you What she said after a brief pause was Will you come by today I dont think so I said She was noshing on flavored yogurt as we talked eating it in little nipping bites Youll see me tomorrow though At the party I hope we get to eat before the thunderstorms Theyre supposed to be bad Im sure we will And are you still thinking I only ask because I dreamed of you when I finally fell asleep again I dreamed of you kissing me Im still thinking I said Thinking hard But in fact I dont remember thinking about anything very hard that day What I remember is drifting further and further into that zone Ive explained so badly Near dusk I went for a long walk in spite of the heat  all the way out to where Lane Fortytwo joins the highway Coming back I stopped on the edge of Tidwells Meadow watching the light fade out of the sky and listening to thunder rumble somewhere over New Hampshire Once more there was that sense of how thin reality was not just here but everywhere how it was stretched like skin over the blood and tissue of a body we can never know clearly in this life I looked at trees and saw arms I looked at bushes and saw faces Ghosts Mattie had said Ghosts with cold breath Time was also thin it seemed to me Kyra and I had really been at the Fryeburg Fair  some version of it anyway we had really visited the year  And at the foot of the meadow the RedTops were almost there now as they once had been in their neat little cabins I could almost hear the sound of their guitars the murmur of their voices and laughter I could almost see the gleam of their lanterns and smell their beef and pork frying Say baby do you remember me one of her songs went Well I aint your honey like I used to be Something rattled in the underbrush to my left I turned that way expecting to see Sara step out of the woods wearing Matties dress and Matties white sneakers In this gloom they would seem almost to float by themselves until she got close to me    There was no one there of course it had undoubtedly been nothing but Chuck the Woodchuck headed home after a hard day at the office but I no longer wanted to be out here watching as the light drained out of the day and the mist came up from the ground I turned for home Instead of going into the house when I got back I made my way along the path to Jos studio where I hadnt been since the night I had taken my IBM back in a dream My way was lit by intermittent flashes of heat lightning The studio was hot but not stale I could smell a peppery aroma that was actually pleasant and wondered if it might be some of Jos herbs There was an air conditioner out here and it worked  I turned it on and then just stood in front of it a little while So much cold air on my overheated body was probably unhealthy but it felt wonderful I didnt feel very wonderful otherwise however I looked around with a growing sense of something too heavy to be mere sadness it felt like despair I think it was caused by the contrast between how little of Jo was left in Sara Laughs and how much of her was still out here I imagined our marriage as a kind of playhouse  and isnt that what marriage is in large part playing house  where only half the stuff was held down Held down by little magnets or hidden cables Something had come along and picked up our playhouse by one corner  easiest thing in the world and I supposed I should be grateful that the something hadnt decided to draw back its foot and kick the poor thing all the way over It just picked up that one corner you see My stuff stayed put but all of Jos had slid    Out of the house and down here Jo I asked and sat down in her chair There was no answer No thumps on the wall No crows or owls calling from the woods I put my hand on her desk where the typewriter had been and slipped my hand across it picking up a film of dust I miss you honey I said and began to cry When the tears were over  again  I wiped my face with the tail of my teeshirt like a little kid then just looked around There was the picture of Sara Tidwell on her desk and a photo I didnt remember on the wall  this latter was old sepiatinted and woodsy Its focal point was a manhigh birchwood cross in a little clearing on a slope above the lake That clearing was gone from the geography now most likely long since filled in by trees I looked at her jars of herbs and mushroom sections her filing cabinets her sections of afghan The green rag rug on the floor The pot of pencils on the desk pencils she had touched and used I held one of them poised over a blank sheet of paper for a moment or two but nothing happened I had a sense of life in this room and a sense of being watched    but not a sense of being helped I know some of it but not enough I said Of all the things I dont know maybe the one that matters most is who wrote help her on the fridge Was it you Jo No answer I sat awhile longer  hoping against hope I suppose  then got up turned off the air conditioning turned off the lights and went back to the house walking in soft bright stutters of unfocused lightning I sat on the deck for a little while watching the night At some point I realized Id taken the length of blue silk ribbon out of my pocket and was winding it nervously back and forth between my fingers making halfassed cats cradles Had it really come from the year  The idea seemed perfectly crazy and perfectly sane at the same time The night hung hot and hushed I imagined old folks all over the TR  perhaps in Motton and Harlow too  laying out their funeral clothes for tomorrow In the doublewide trailer on Wasp Hill Road Ki was sitting on the floor watching a videotape of The Jungle Book  Baloo and Mowgli were singing The Bare Necessities Mattie was on the couch with her feet up reading the new Mary Higgins Clark and singing along Both were wearing shorty pajamas Kis pink Matties white After a little while I lost my sense of them it faded the way radio signals sometimes do late at night I went into the north bedroom undressed and crawled onto the top sheet of my unmade bed I fell asleep almost at once I woke in the middle of the night with someone running a hot finger up and down the middle of my back I rolled over and when the lightning flashed I saw there was a woman in bed with me It was Sara Tidwell She was grinning There were no pupils in her eyes Oh sugar Im almost back she whispered in the dark I had a sense of her reaching out for me again but when the next flash of lightning came that side of the bed was empty Inspiration isnt always a matter of ghosts moving magnets around on refrigerator doors and on Tuesday morning I had a flash that was a beaut It came while I was shaving and thinking about nothing more than remembering the beer for the party And like the best inspirations it came out of nowhere at all I hurried into the living room not quite running wiping the shaving cream off my face with a towel as I went I glanced briefly at the Tough Stuff crossword collection lying on top of my manuscript That had been where Id gone first in an effort to decipher go down nineteen and go down ninetytwo Not an unreasonable startingpoint but what did Tough Stuff have to do with TR I had purchased the book at Mr Paperback in Derry and of the thirty or so puzzles Id completed Id done all but half a dozen in Derry TR ghosts could hardly be expected to show an interest in my Derry crossword collection The telephone book on the other hand I snatched it off the diningroom table Although it covered the whole southern part of Castle County  Motton Harlow and Kashwakamak as well as the TR  it was pretty thin The first thing I did was check the white pages to see if there were at least ninetytwo There were The Ys and Zs finished up on page ninetyseven This was the answer Had to be I got it didnt I I asked Bunter This is it Nothing Not even a tinkle from the bell Fuck you  what does a stuffed moosehead know about a telephone book Go down nineteen I turned to page nineteen of the telephone book where the letter F was prominently showcased I began to slip my finger down the first column and as it went my excitement faded The nineteenth name on page nineteen was Harold Failles It meant nothing to me There were also Feltons and Fenners a Filkersham and several Finneys half a dozen Flahertys and more Fosses than you could shake a stick at The last name on page nineteen was Framingham It also meant nothing to me but  Framingham Kenneth P I stared at that for a moment A realization began to dawn It had nothing to do with the refrigerator messages Youre not seeing what you think youre seeing I thought This is like when you buy a blue Buick  You see blue Buicks everywhere I said Practically got to kick em out of your way Yeah thats it But my hands were shaking as I turned to page ninetytwo Here were the Ts of southern Castle County along with a few Us like Alton Ubeck and Catherine Udell just to round things out I didnt bother checking the ninetysecond entry on the page the phone book wasnt the key to the magnetic crosspatches after all It did however suggest something enormous I closed the book just held it in my hands for a moment happy folks with blueberry rakes on the front cover then opened it at random this time to the Ms And once you knew what you were looking for it jumped right out at you All those Ks Oh there were Stevens and Johns and Marthas there was Meserve G and Messier V and Jayhouse T And yet again and again I saw the initial K where people had exercised their right not to list their first name in the book There were at least twenty Kinitials on page fifty alone and another dozen Cinitials As for the actual names themselves    There were twelve Kenneths on this random page in the Msection including three Kenneth Moores and two Kenneth Munters There were four Catherines and two Katherines There were a Casey a Kiana and a Kiefer Holy Christ its like fallout I whispered I thumbed through the book not able to believe what I was seeing and seeing it anyway Kenneths Katherines and Keiths were everywhere I also saw Kimberly Kim and Kym There were Cammie Kia yes and we had thought ourselves so original Kiah Kendra Kaela Keil and Kyle Kirby and Kirk There was a woman named Kissy Bowden and a man named Kito Rennie  Kito the same name as one of Kyras fridgeafator people And everywhere outnumbering such usually common initials as S and T and E were those Ks My eyes danced with them I turned to look at the clock  didnt want to stand John Storrow up at the airport Christ no  and there was no clock there Of course not Old Krazy Kat had popped his peepers during a psychic event I gave a loud braying laugh that scared me a little  it wasnt particularly sane Get hold of yourself Mike I said Take a deep breath son I took the breath Held it Let it out Checked the digital readout on the microwave Quarter past eight Plenty of time for John I turned back to the telephone book and began to riffle rapidly through it Id had a second inspiration  not a megawatt blast like the first one but a lot more accurate it turned out Western Maine is a relatively isolated area  its a little like the hill country of the border South  but there has always been at least some inflow of folks from away flatlanders is the term the locals use when they are feeling contemptuous and in the last quarter of the century it has become a popular area for active seniors who want to fish and ski their way through retirement The phone book goes a long way toward separating the newbies from the longtime residents Babickis Parettis OQuindlans Donahues Smolnacks Dvoraks Blindermeyers  all from away All flatlanders Jalberts Meserves Pillsburys Spruces Therriaults Perraults Stanchfields Starbirds Dubays  all from Castle County You see what Im saying dont you When you see a whole column of Bowies on page twelve you know that those folks have been around long enough to relax and really spread those Bowie genes There were a few Kinitials and Knames among the Parettis and the Smolnacks but only a few The heavy concentrations were all attached to families that had been here long enough to absorb the atmosphere To breathe the fallout Except it wasnt radiation exactly it  I suddenly imagined a black headstone taller than the tallest tree on the lake a monolith which cast its shadow over half of Castle County This picture was so clear and so terrible that I covered my eyes dropping the phone book on the table I backed away from it shuddering Hiding my eyes actually seemed to enhance the image further a gravemarker so enormous it blotted out the sun TR lay at its foot like a funeral bouquet Sara Tidwells son had drowned in Dark Score Lake    or been drowned in it But she had marked his passing Memorialized it I wondered if anyone else in town had ever noticed what I just had I didnt suppose it was all that likely when you open a telephone book youre looking for a specific name in most cases not reading whole pages line by line I wondered if Jo had noticed  if shed known that almost every longtime family in this part of the world had in one way or another named at least one child after Sara Tidwells dead son Jo wasnt stupid I thought she probably had I returned to the bathroom relathered started again from scratch When I finished I went back to the phone and picked it up I poked in three numbers then stopped looking out at the lake Mattie and Ki were up and in the kitchen both of them wearing aprons both of them in a fine froth of excitement There was going to be a party They would wear pretty new summer clothes and there would be music from Matties boombox CD player Ki was helping Mattie make biscuits for strewberry snortcake and while the biscuits were baking they would make salads If I called Mattie up and said Pack a couple of bags you and Ki are going to spend a week at Disney World Mattie would assume I was joking then tell me to hurry up and finish getting dressed so Id be at the airport when Johns plane landed If I pressed shed remind me that Lindy had offered her her old job back but the offer would close in a hurry if Mattie didnt show up promptly at two PM on Friday If I continued to press she would just say no Because I wasnt the only one in the zone was I I wasnt the only one who was really feeling it I returned the phone to its recharging cradle then went back into the north bedroom By the time Id finished dressing my fresh shirt was already feeling wilted under the arms it was as hot that morning as it had been for the last week maybe even hotter But Id be in plenty of time to meet the plane I had never felt less like partying but Id be there Mikey on the spot that was me Mikey on the goddam spot John hadnt given me his flight number but at Castle County Airport such niceties are hardly necessary This bustling hub of transport consists of three hangars and a terminal which used to be a Flying A gas station  when the lights strong on the little buildings rusty north side you can still see the shape of that winged A Theres one runway Security is provided by Lassie Breck Pellerins ancient collie who spends her days crashed out on the linoleum floor cocking an ear at the ceiling whenever a plane lands or takes off I popped my head into Pellerins office and asked him if the ten from Boston was on time He said it twas although he hoped the paaty I was meetin planned to either fly back out before midafternoon or stay the night Bad weather was comin in good gorry yes What Breck Pellerin referred to as lectrical weather I knew exactly what he meant because in my nervous system that electricity already seemed to have arrived I went out to the runway side of the terminal and sat on a bench advertising Cormiers Market FLY INTO OUR DELI FOR THE BEST MEATS IN MAINE The sun was a silver button stuck on the eastern slope of a hot white sky Headache weather my mother would have called it but the weather was due to change I would hold onto the hope of that change as best I could At ten past ten I heard a waspwhine from the south At quarter past some sort of twinengine plane dropped out of the murk flopped onto the runway and taxied toward the terminal There were only four passengers and John Storrow was the first one off I grinned when I saw him I had to grin He was wearing a black teeshirt with WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS printed across the front and a pair of khaki shorts which displayed a perfect set of city shins white and bony He was trying to manage both a Styrofoam cooler and a briefcase I grabbed the cooler maybe four seconds before he dropped it and tucked it under my arm Mike he cried lifting one hand palm out John I returned in much the same spirit evoe is the word that comes immediately to the crossword aficionados mind and slapped him five His homelyhandsome face split in a grin and I felt a little stab of guilt Mattie had expressed no preference for John  quite the opposite in fact  and he really hadnt solved any of her problems Devore had done that by topping himself before John had so much as a chance to get started on her behalf Yet still I felt that nasty little poke Come on he said Lets get out of this heat You have air conditioning in your car I presume Absolutely What about a cassette player You got one of those If you do Ill play you something thatll make you chortle I dont think Ive ever heard that word actually used in conversation John The grin shone out again and I noticed what a lot of freckles he had Sheriff Andys boy Opie grows up to serve at the bar Im a lawyer I use words in conversation that havent even been invented yet You have a tapeplayer Of course I do I hefted the cooler Steaks You bet Peter Lugers Theyre     the best in the world You told me As we went into the terminal someone said Michael It was Romeo Bissonette the lawyer who had chaperoned me through my deposition In one hand he had a box wrapped in blue paper and tied with a white ribbon Beside him just rising from one of the lumpy chairs was a tall guy with a fringe of gray hair He was wearing a brown suit a blue shirt and a string tie with a golfclub on the clasp He looked more like a farmer on auction day than the sort of guy whod be a scream when you got a drink or two into him but I had no doubt this was the private detective He stepped over the comatose collie and shook hands with me George Kennedy Mr Noonan Im pleased to meet you My wife has read every single book you ever wrote Well thank her for me I will I have one in the car  a hardcover     He looked shy as so many people do when they get right to the point of asking I wonder if youd sign it for her at some point Id be delighted to I said Right aways best then I wont forget I turned to Romeo Good to see you Romeo Make it Rommie he said Good to see you too He held out the box George and I clubbed together on this We thought you deserved something nice for helping a damsel in distress Kennedy now did look like a man who might be fun after a few drinks The kind who might just take a notion to hop onto the nearest table turn a tablecloth into a kilt and dance I looked at John who gave the kind of shrug that means hey dont ask me I pulled off the satin bow slipped my finger under the Scotch tape holding the paper then looked up I caught Rommie Bissonette in the act of elbowing Kennedy Now they were both grinning Theres nothing in here thats going to jump out at me and go boogabooga is there guys I asked Absolutely not Rommie said but his grin widened Well I can be as good a sport as the next guy I guess I unwrapped the package opened the plain white box inside revealed a square pad of cotton lifted it out I had been smiling all through this but now I felt the smile curl up and die on my mouth Something went twisting up my spine as well and I think I came very close to dropping the box It was the oxygen mask Devore had had on his lap when he met me on The Street the one hed snorted from occasionally as he and Rogette paced me trying to keep me out deep enough to drown Rommie Bissonette and George Kennedy had brought it to me like the scalp of a dead enemy and I was supposed to think it was funny  Mike Rommie asked anxiously Mike are you okay It was just a joke   I blinked and saw it wasnt an oxygen mask at all  how in Gods name could I have been so stupid For one thing it was bigger than Devores mask for another it was made of opaque rather than clear plastic It was  I gave a tentative chuckle Rommie Bissonette looked tremendously relieved So did Kennedy John only looked puzzled Funny I said Like a rubber crutch I pulled out the little mike from inside the mask and let it dangle It swung back and forth on its wire reminding me of the waggy clocks tail What the hell is it John asked Park Avenue lawyer Rommie said to George broadening his accent so it came out Paaaak Avenew lawyah Aint nevah seen one of these have ya chummy Nossir coss not Then he reverted to normalspeak which was sort of a relief Ive lived in Maine my whole life and for me the amusement value of burlesque Yankee accents has worn pretty thin Its a Stenomask The stenog keeping the record at Mikes depo was wearing one Mike kept looking at him   It freaked me out I said Old guy sitting in the corner and mumbling into the Mask of Zorro Gerry Bliss freaks a lot of people out Kennedy said He spoke in a low rumble Hes the last one around here who wears em Hes got ten or eleven left in his mudroom I know because I bought that one from him I hope he stuck it to you I said I thought it would make a nice memento Rommie said but for a second there I thought Id given you the box with the severed hand in it  I hate it when I mix up my giftboxes like that Whats the deal Its been a long hot July I said Put it down to that I hung the Stenomasks strap over one finger dangling it that way Mattie said to be there by eleven John told us Were going to drink beer and throw the Frisbee around I can do both of those things quite well George Kennedy said Outside in the tiny parking lot George went to a dusty Altima rummaged in the back and came out with a battered copy of The RedShirt Man Frieda made me bring this one She has the newer ones but this is her favorite Sorry about how it looks  shes read it about six times II Its my favorite too I said which was true And I like to see a book with mileage That was also true I opened the book looked approvingly at a smear of longdried chocolate on the flyleaf and then wrote For Frieda Kennedy whose husband was there to lend a hand Thanks for sharing him and thanks For reading Mike Noonan That was a long inscription for me  usually I just stick to Best wishes or Good luck but I wanted to make up for the curdled expression they had seen on my face when I opened their innocent little gag present While I was scribbling George asked me if I was working on a new novel No I said Batteries currently on recharge I handed the book back Frieda wont like that No But theres always RedShirt Well follow you Rommie said and a rumble came from deep in the west It was no louder than the thunder which had rumbled on and off for the last week but this wasnt dry thunder We all knew it and we all looked in that direction Think well get a chance to eat before it storms George asked me Yeah Just about barely I drove to the gate of the parking lot and glanced right to check for traffic When I did I saw John looking at me thoughtfully What Mattie said you were writing thats all Book go titsup on you or something My Childhood Friend was just as lively as ever in fact    but it would never be finished I knew that this morning as well as I knew there was rain on the way The boys in the basement had for some reason decided to take it back Asking why might not be such a good idea  the answers might be unpleasant Something Im not sure just what I pulled out onto the highway checked behind me and saw Rommie and George following in Georges little Altima America has become a country full of big men in little cars What do you want me to listen to If its home karaoke I pass The last thing on earth I want to hear is you singing Bubba Shot the Jukebox Last Night Oh its better than that he said Miles better He opened his briefcase rooted through it and came out with a plastic cassette box The tape inside was marked   yesterday I love this he said He leaned forward turned on the radio then popped the cassette into the player I was hoping Id already had my quota of nasty surprises for the morning but I was wrong Sorry I just had to get rid of another call John said from my Chevys speakers in his smoothest most lawyerly voice Id have bet a million dollars that his bony shins hadnt been showing when this tape was made There was a laugh both smoky and grating My stomach seized up at the sound of it I remembered seeing her for the first time standing outside The Sunset Bar wearing black shorts over a black tankstyle swimsuit Standing there and looking like a refugee from crashdiet hell You mean you had to turn on your taperecorder she said and now I remembered how the water had seemed to change color when she nailed me that really good one in the back of the head From bright orange to dark scarlet it had gone And then Id started drinking the lake Thats okay Tape anything you want John reached out suddenly and ejected the cassette You dont need to hear this he said Its not substantive I thought youd get a kick out of her blather but    man you look terrible Do you want me to drive Youre white as a fucking sheet I can drive I said Go on play it Afterward Ill tell you about a little adventure I had Friday night    but youre going to keep it to yourself They dont have to know  I jerked my thumb over my shoulder at the Altima  and Mattie doesnt have to know Especially Mattie He reached for the tape then hesitated Youre sure Yeah It was just hearing her again out of the blue like that The quality of her voice Christ the reproduction is good Nothing but the best for Avery McLain and Bernstein We have very strict protocols about what we can tape by the way If you were wondering I wasnt I imagine none of its admissible in litigation anyway is it In certain rare cases a judge might let a tape in but thats not why we do it A tape like this saved a mans life four years ago right around the time I joined the firm That guy is now in the Witness Protection Program Play it He leaned forward and pushed the button John How is the desert Ms Whitmore Whitmore Hot John Arrangements progressing nicely I know how difficult times like this can   Whitmore You know very little counsellor take it from me Can we cut the crap John Consider it cut Whitmore Have you conveyed the conditions of Mr Devores will to his daughterinlaw John Yes maam Whitmore Her response John I have none to give you now I may have after Mr Devores will has been probated But surely you know that such codicils are rarely if ever accepted by the courts Whitmore Well if that little lady moves out of town well see wont we John I suppose we will Whitmore When is the victory party John Excuse me Whitmore Oh please I have sixty different appointments today plus a boss to bury tomorrow Youre going up there to celebrate with her and her daughter arent you Did you know shes invited the writer Her fuckbuddy John turned to me gleefully Do you hear how pissed she sounds Shes trying to hide it but she cant Its eating her up inside I barely heard him I was in the zone with what she was saying the writer her fuckbuddy and what was under what she was saying Some quality beneath the words We just want to see how long you can swim she had called out to me John I hardly think what I or Matties friends do is any of your business Ms Whitmore May I respectfully suggest that you party with your friends and let Mattie Devore party with h  Whitmore Give him a message Me She was talking about me Then I realized it was even more personal than that  she was talking to me Her body might be on the other side of the country but her voice and spiteful spirit were right here in the car with us And Max Devores will Not the meaningless shit his lawyers had put down on paper but his will The old bastard was as dead as Damocles but yes he was definitely still seeking custody John Give who a message Ms Whitmore Whitmore Tell him he never answered Mr Devores question John What question is that Does her cunt suck Whitmore Ask him Hell know John If you mean Mike Noonan you can ask him yourself Youll see him in Castle County Probate Court this fall Whitmore I hardly think so Mr Devores will was made and witnessed out here John Nevertheless it will be probated in Maine where he died My heart is set on it And when you leave Castle County the next time Rogette you will do so with your education in matters of the law considerably broadened For the first time she sounded angry her voice rising to a reedy caw Whitmore If you think   John I dont think I know Goodbye Ms Whitmore Whitmore You might do well to stay away from   There was a click the hum of an open line then a robot voice saying Nineforty AM    Eastern Daylight    July    twentieth John punched EJECT collected his tape and stored it back in his briefcase I hung up on her He sounded like a man telling you about his first skydive I actually did She was mad wasnt she Wouldnt you say she was seriously pissed Yeah It was what he wanted to hear but not what I really believed Pissed yes Seriously pissed Maybe not Because Matties location and state of mind hadnt been her concern Rogette had called to talk to me To tell me she was thinking of me To bring back memories of how it felt to tread water with the back of your head gushing blood To freak me out And she had succeeded What was the question you didnt answer John asked me I dont know what she meant by that I said but I can tell you why hearing her turned me a little white in the gills If you can be discreet and if you want to hear Weve got eighteen miles to cover lay it on me I told him about Friday night I didnt clutter my version with visions or psychic phenomena there was just Michael Noonan out for a sunset walk along The Street Id been standing by a birch tree which hung over the lake watching the sun drop toward the mountains when they came up behind me From the point where Devore charged me with his wheelchair to the point where I finally got back onto solid ground I stuck pretty much to the truth When I finished John was at first utterly silent It was a measure of how thrown for a loop he was under normal circumstances he was every bit the chatterbox Ki was Well I asked Comments Questions Lift your hair so I can see behind your ear I did as he asked revealing a big BandAid and a large area of swelling John leaned forward to study it like a little kid observing his best friends battlescar during recess Holy shit he said at last It was my turn to say nothing Those two old fucks tried to drown you I said nothing They tried to drown you for helping Mattie Now I really said nothing And you never reported it I started to I said then realized Id make myself look like a whiny little asshole And a liar most likely How much do you think Osgood might know About them trying to drown me Nothing Hes just a messenger boy A little more of that unusual quiet from John After a few seconds of it he reached out and touched the lump on the back of my head Ow Sorry A pause Jesus Then he went back to Warringtons and pulled the pin Jesus Michael I never would have played that tape if Id known   Its all right But dont even think of telling Mattie Im wearing my hair over my ear like that for a reason Will you ever tell her do you think I might Some day when hes been dead long enough so we can laugh about me swimming with my clothes on That might be awhile he said Yeah It might We drove in silence for a bit I could sense John groping for a way to bring the day back to jubilation and loved him for it He leaned forward turned on the radio and found something loud and nasty by Guns n Roses  welcome to the jungle baby we got fun and games Party til we puke he said Right I grinned It wasnt easy with the sound of the old womans voice still clinging to me like light slime but I managed If you insist I said I do he said Most certainly John youre a good guy for a lawyer And youre a good one for a writer This time the grin on my face felt more natural and stayed on longer We passed the marker reading TR and as we did the sun burned through the haze and flooded the day with light It seemed like an omen of better times ahead until I looked into the west There black in the bright I could see the thunderheads building up over the White Mountains For men I think love is a thing formed of equal parts lust and astonishment The astonishment part women understand The lust part they only think they understand Very few perhaps one in twenty  have any concept of what it really is or how deep it runs Thats probably just as well for their sleep and peace of mind And Im not talking about the lust of satyrs and rapists and molesters Im talking about the lust of shoeclerks and highschool principals Not to mention writers and lawyers We turned into Matties dooryard at ten to eleven and as I parked my Chevy beside her rustedout Jeep the trailer door opened and Mattie came out on the top step I sucked in my breath and beside me I could hear John sucking in his She was very likely the most beautiful young woman I have ever seen in my life as she stood there in her rosecolored shorts and matching middy top The shorts were not short enough to be cheap my mothers word but plenty short enough to be provocative Her top tied in floppy string bows across the shoulders and showed just enough tan to dream on Her hair hung to her shoulders She was smiling and waving I thought Shes made it  take her into the countryclub dining room now dressed just as she is and she shuts everyone else down Oh Lordy John said There was a kind of dismayed longing in his voice All that and a bag of chips Yeah I said Put your eyes back in your head big boy He made cupping motions with his hands as if doing just that George meanwhile had pulled his Altima in next to us Come on I said opening my door Time to party I cant touch her Mike John said Ill melt Come on you goof Mattie came down the steps and past the pot with the tomato plant in it Ki was behind her dressed in an outfit similar to her mothers only in a shade of dark green She had the shys again I saw she kept one steadying hand on Matties leg and one thumb in her mouth The guys are here The guys are here Mattie cried laughing and threw herself into my arms She hugged me tight and kissed the corner of my mouth I hugged her back and kissed her cheek Then she moved on to John read his shirt patted her hands together in applause and then hugged him He hugged back pretty well for a guy who was afraid he might melt I thought picking her up off her feet and swinging her around in a circle while she hung onto his neck and laughed Rich lady rich lady rich lady John chanted then set her down on the cork soles of her white shoes Free lady free lady free lady she chanted back The hell with rich Before he could reply she kissed him firmly on the mouth His arms rose to slip around her but she stepped back before they could catch hold She turned to Rommie and George who were standing sidebyside and looking like fellows who might want to explain all about the Mormon Church I took a step forward meaning to do the introductions but John was taking care of that and one of his arms managed to accomplish its mission after all  it circled her waist as he led her forward toward the men Meanwhile a little hand slipped into mine I looked down and saw Ki looking up at me Her face was grave and pale and every bit as beautiful as her mothers Her blonde hair freshly washed and shining was held back with a velvet scrunchy Guess the fridgeafator people dont like me now she said The laughter and insouciance were gone at least for the moment She looked on the verge of tears My letters all went byebye I picked her up and set her in the crook of my arm as I had on the day Id met her walking down the middle of Route  in her bathing suit I kissed her forehead and then the tip of her nose Her skin was perfect silk I know they did I said Ill buy you some more Promise Doubtful dark blue eyes fixed on mine Promise And Ill teach you special words like zygote and bibulous I know lots of special words How many A hundred and eighty Thunder rumbled in the west It didnt seem louder but it was more focused somehow Kis eyes went in that direction then came back to mine Im scared Mike Scared Of what Ofi dont know The lady in Matties dress The men we saw Then she looked over my shoulder Here comes Mommy I have heard actresses deliver the line Not in front of the children in that exact same tone of voice Kyra wiggled in the circle of my arms Land me I landed her Mattie John Rommie and George came over to join us Ki ran to Mattie who picked her up and then eyed us like a general surveying her troops Got the beer she asked me Yessum A case of Bud and a dozen mixed sodas as well Plus lemonade Great Mr Kennedy   George maam George then And if you call me maam again Ill punch you in the nose Im Mattie Would you drive down to the Lakeview Generalshe pointed to the store on Route  about half a mile from us  and get some ice You bet Mr Bissonette   Rommie Theres a little garden at the north end of the trailer Rommie Can you find a couple of goodlooking lettuces I think I can handle that John lets get the meat into the fridge As for you Michael     She pointed to the barbecue The briquets are the selflighting kind  just drop a match and stand back Do your duty Aye good lady I said and dropped to my knees in front of her That finally got a giggle out of Ki Laughing Mattie took my hand and pulled me back onto my feet Come on Sir Galahad she said Its going to rain I want to be safe inside and too stuffed to jump when it does In the city parties begin with greetings at the door gatheredin coats and those peculiar little airkisses when exactly did that social oddity begin In the country they begin with chores You fetch you carry you hunt for stuff like barbecue tongs and oven mitts The hostess drafts a couple of men to move the picnic table then decides it was actually better where it was and asks them to put it back And at some point you discover that youre having fun I piled briquets until they looked approximately like the pyramid on the bag then touched a match to them They blazed up satisfyingly and I stood back wiping my forearm across my forehead Cool and clear might be coming but it surely wasnt in hailing distance yet The sun had burned through and the day had gone from dull to dazzling yet in the west blacksatin thunderheads continued to stack up It was as if night had burst a bloodvessel in the sky over there Mike I looked around at Kyra What honey Will you take care of me Yes I said with no hesitation at all For a moment something about my response  perhaps only the quickness of it  seemed to trouble her Then she smiled Okay she said Look here comes the iceman George was back from the store He parked and got out I walked over with Kyra she holding my hand and swinging it possessively back and forth Rommie came with us juggling three heads of lettuce  I didnt think he was much of a threat to the guy who had fascinated Ki on the common Saturday night George opened the Altimas back door and brought out two bags of ice The store was closed he said Sign said WILL REOPEN AT  PM That seemed a little too long to wait so I took the ice and put the money through the mailslot Theyd closed for Royce Merrills funeral of course Had given up almost a full days custom at the height of the tourist season to see the old fellow into the ground It was sort of touching I thought it was also sort of creepy Can I carry some ice Kyra asked I guess but dont frizzicate yourself George said and carefully put a fivepound bag of ice into Kis outstretched arms Frizzicate Kyra said giggling She began walking toward the trailer where Mattie was just coming out John was behind her and regarding her with the eyes of a gutshot beagle Mommy look Im frizzicating I took the other bag I know the icebox is outside but dont they keep a padlock on it I am friends with most padlocks George said Oh I see Mike Catch John tossed a red Frisbee It floated toward me but high I jumped for it snagged it and suddenly Devore was back in my head Whats wrong with you Rogette You never used to throw like a girl Get him I looked down and saw Ki looking up Dont think about sad stuff she said I smiled at her then flipped her the Frisbee Okay no sad stuff Go on sweetheart Toss it to your mom Lets see if you can She smiled back turned and made a quick accurate flip to her mother  the toss was so hard that Mattie almost flubbed it Whatever else Kyra Devore might have been she was a Frisbee champion in the making Mattie tossed the Frisbee to George who turned the tail of his absurd brown suitcoat flaring and caught it deftly behind his back Mattie laughed and applauded the hem of her top flirting with her navel Showoff John called from the steps Jealousy is such an ugly emotion George said to Rommie Bissonette and flipped him the Frisbee Rommie floated it back to John but it went wide and bonked off the side of the trailer As John hurried down the steps to get it Mattie turned to me My boombox is on the coffeetable in the living room along with a stack of CDs Most of them are pretty old but at least its music Will you bring them out Sure I went inside where it was hot in spite of three strategically placed fans working overtime I looked at the grim massproduced furniture and at Matties rather noble effort to impart some character the van Gogh print that should not have looked at home in a trailer kitchenette but did Edward Hoppers Nighthawks over the sofa the tiedyed curtains that would have made Jo laugh There was a bravery here that made me sad for her and furious at Max Devore all over again Dead or not I wanted to kick his ass I went into the living room and saw the new Mary Higgins Clark on the sofa endtable with a bookmark sticking out of it Lying beside it in a heap were a couple of littlegirl hair ribbons  something about them looked familiar to me although I couldnt remember ever having seen Ki wearing them I stood there a moment longer frowning then grabbed the boombox and CDs and went back outside Hey guys I said Lets rock I was okay until she danced I dont know if it matters to you but it does to me I was okay until she danced After that I was lost We took the Frisbee around to the rear of the house partly so we wouldnt piss off any funeralbound townies with our rowdiness and good cheer mostly because Matties back yard was a good place to play  level ground and low grass After a couple of missed catches Mattie kicked off her partyshoes dashed barefoot into the house and came back in her sneakers After that she was a lot better We threw the Frisbee yelled insults at each other drank beer laughed a lot Ki wasnt much on the catching part but she had a phenomenal arm for a kid of three and played with gusto Rommie had set the boombox up on the trailers back step and it spun out a haze of lateeighties and earlynineties music U Tears for Fears the Eurythmics Crowded House A Flock of Seagulls AhHah the Bangles Melissa Etheridge Huey Lewis and the News It seemed to me that I knew every song every riff We sweated and sprinted in the noon light We watched Matties long tanned legs flash and listened to the bright runs of Kyras laughter At one point Rommie Bissonette went head over heels all the change spilling out of his pockets and John laughed until he had to sit down Tears rolled from his eyes Ki ran over and plopped on his defenseless lap John stopped laughing in a hurry Ooofl he cried looking at me with shining wounded eyes as his bruised balls no doubt tried to climb back inside his body Kyra Devore Mattie cried looking at John apprehensively I taggled my own quartermack Ki said proudly John smiled feebly at her and staggered to his feet Yes he said You did And the ref calls fifteen yards for squashing Are you okay man George asked He looked concerned but his voice was grinning Im fine John said and spun him the Frisbee It wobbled feebly across the yard Go on throw Lets see whatcha got The thunder rumbled louder but the black clouds were all still west of us the sky overhead remained a harmless humid blue Birds still sang and crickets hummed in the grass There was a heatshimmer over the barbecue and it would soon be time to slap on Johns New York steaks The Frisbee still flew red against the green of the grass and trees the blue of the sky I was still in lust but everything was still all right  men are in lust all over the world and damned near all of the time and the icecaps dont melt But she danced and everything changed It was an old Don Henley song one driven by a really nasty guitar riff Oh God I love this one Mattie cried The Frisbee came to her She caught it dropped it stepped on it as if it were a hot red spot falling on a nightclub stage and began to shake She put her hands first behind her neck and then on her hips and then behind her back She danced standing with the toes of her sneakers on the Frisbee She danced without moving She danced as they say in that song  like a wave on the ocean The government bugged the mens room in the local disco lounge And all she wants to do is dance dance    To keep the boys from selling all the weapons they can scrounge And all she wants to do all she wants to do is dance Women are sexy when they dance  incredibly sexy  but that wasnt what I reacted to or how I reacted The lust I was coping with but this was more than lust and not copeable It was something that sucked the wind out of me and left me feeling utterly at her mercy In that moment she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen not a pretty woman in shorts and a middy top dancing in place on a Frisbee but Venus revealed She was everything I had missed during the last four years when Id been so badly off I didnt know I was missing anything She robbed me of any last defenses I might have had The age difference didnt matter If I looked to people like my tongue was hanging out even when my mouth was shut then so be it If I lost my dignity my pride my sense of self then so be it Four years on my own had taught me there are worse things to lose How long did she stand there dancing I dont know Probably not long not even a minute and then she realized we were looking at her rapt  because to some degree they all saw what I saw and felt what I felt For that minute or however long it was I dont think any of us used much oxygen She stepped off the Frisbee laughing and blushing at the same time confused but not really uncomfortable Im sorry she said I just    I love that song All she wants to do is dance Rommie said Yes sometimes thats all she wants Mattie said and blushed harder than ever Excuse me I have to use the facility She tossed me the Frisbee and then dashed for the trailer I took a deep breath trying to steady myself back to reality and saw John doing the same thing George Kennedy was wearing a mildly stunned expression as if someone had fed him a light sedative and it was finally taking effect Thunder rumbled This time it did sound closer I skimmed the Frisbee to Rommie What do you think I think Im in love he said and then seemed to give himself a small mental shake  it was a thing you could see in his eyes I also think its time we got going on those steaks if were going to eat outside Want to help me Sure I will too John said We walked back to the trailer leaving George and Kyra to play toss Kyra was asking George if he had ever caught any crinimals In the kitchen Mattie was standing beside the open fridge and stacking steaks on a platter Thank God you guys came in I was on the point of giving up and gobbling one of these just the way it is Theyre the most beautiful things I ever saw Youre the most beautiful thing I ever saw John said He was being totally sincere but the smile she gave him was distracted and a little bemused I made a mental note to myself never compliment a woman on her beauty when she has a couple of raw steaks in her hands It just doesnt turn the windmill somehow How are you at barbecuing meat she asked me Tell the truth because these are way too good to mess up I can hold my own Okay youre hired John youre assisting Rommie help me do salads My pleasure George and Ki had come around to the front of the trailer and were now sitting in lawnchairs like a couple of old cronies at their London club George was telling Ki how he had shot it out with Rolfe Nedeau and the Real Bad Gang on Lisbon Street in  George whats happening to your nose John asked Its getting so long Do you mind George asked Im having a conversation here Mr Kennedy has caught lots of crooked crinimals Kyra said He caught the Real Bad Gang and put them in Supermax Yes I said Mr Kennedy also won an Academy Award for acting in a movie called Cool Hand Luke Thats absolutely correct George said He raised his right hand and crossed the two fingers Me and Paul Newman Just like that We have his pusgetti sauce Ki said gravely and that got John laughing again It didnt hit me the same way but laughter is catching just watching John was enough to break me up after a few seconds We were howling like a couple of fools as we slapped the steaks on the grill Its a wonder we didnt burn our hands off Why are they laughing Ki asked George Because theyre foolish men with little tiny brains George said Now listen Ki  I got them all except for the Human Headcase He jumped into his car and I jumped into mine The details of that chase are nothing for a little girl to hear   George regaled her with them anyway while John and I stood grinning at each other across Matties barbecue This is great isnt it John said and I nodded Mattie came out with corn wrapped in aluminum foil followed by Rommie who had a large salad bowl clasped in his arms and negotiated the steps carefully trying to peer over the top of the bowl as he made his way down them We sat at the picnic table George and Rommie on one side John and I flanking Mattie on the other Ki sat at the head perched on a stack of old magazines in a lawnchair Mattie tied a dishtowel around her neck an indignity Ki submitted to only because a she was wearing new clothes and b a dishtowel wasnt a babybib at least technically speaking We ate hugely  salad steak and John was right it really was the best Id ever had roasted corn on the cob strewberry snortcake for dessert By the time wed gotten around to the snortcake the thunderheads were noticeably closer and there was a hot jerky breeze blowing around the yard Mattie if I never eat a meal as good as this one again I wont be surprised Rommie said Thanks ever so much for having me Thank you she said There were tears standing in her eyes She took my hand on one side and Johns on the other She squeezed both Thank you all If you knew what things were like for Ki and me before this last week     She shook her head gave John and me a final squeeze and let go But thats over Look at the baby George said amused Ki had slumped back in her lawnchair and was looking at us with glazing eyes Most of her hair had come out of the scrunchy and lay in clumps against her cheeks There was a dab of whipped cream on her nose and a single yellow kernel of corn sitting in the middle of her chin I threw the Frisbee six fousan times Kyra said She spoke in a distant declamatory tone I tired Mattie started to get up I put my hand on her arm Let me She nodded smiling If you want I picked Kyra up and carried her around to the steps Thunder rumbled again a long low roll that sounded like the snarl of a huge dog I looked up at the encroaching clouds and as I did movement caught my eye It was an old blue car heading west on Wasp Hill Road toward the lake The only reason I noticed it was that it was wearing one of those stupid bumperstickers from the Village Cafe HORN BROKEN  WATCH FOR FINGER I carried Ki up the steps and through the door turning her so I wouldnt bump her head Take care of me she said in her sleep There was a sadness in her voice that chilled me It was as if she knew she was asking the impossible Take care of me Im little Mama says Im a little guy Ill take care of you I said and kissed that silky place between her eyes again Dont worry Ki go to sleep I carried her to her room and put her on her bed By then she was totally conked out I wiped the cream off her nose and picked the cornkernel off her chin I glanced at my watch and saw it was ten til two They would be gathering at Grace Baptist by now Bill Dean was wearing a gray tie Buddy Jellison had a hat on He was standing behind the church with some other men who were smoking before going inside I turned Mattie was in the doorway Mike she said Come here please I went to her There was no cloth between her waist and my hands this time Her skin was warm and as silky as her daughters She looked up at me her lips parted Her hips pressed forward and when she felt what was hard down there she pressed harder against it Mike she said again I closed my eyes I felt like someone who has just come to the doorway of a brightly lit room full of people laughing and talking And dancing Because sometimes that is all we want to do I want to come in I thought Thats what I want to do all I want to do Let me do what I want Let me  I realized I was saying it aloud whispering it rapidly into her ear as I held her with my hands going up and down her back my fingertips ridging her spine touching her shoulderblades then coming around in front to cup her small breasts Yes she said What we both want Yes Thats fine Slowly she reached up with her thumbs and wiped the wet places from under my eyes I drew back from her The key   She smiled a little You know where it is Ill come tonight Good Ive been     I had to clear my throat I looked at Kyra who was deeply asleep Ive been lonely I dont think I knew it but I have been Me too And I knew it for both of us Kiss please I kissed her I think our tongues touched but Im not sure What I remember most clearly is the liveness of her She was like a dreidel lightly spinning in my arms Hey John called from outside and we sprang apart You guys want to give us a little help Its gonna rain Thanks for finally making up your mind she said to me in a low voice She turned and hurried back up the doublewides narrow corridor The next time she spoke to me I dont think she knew who she was talking to or where she was The next time she spoke to me she was dying Dont wake the baby I heard her tell John and his response Oh sorry sorry I stood where I was a moment longer getting my breath then slipped into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face I remember seeing a blue plastic whale in the bathtub as I turned to take a towel off the rack I remember thinking that it probably blew bubbles out of its spouthole and I even remember having a momentary glimmer of an idea  a childrens story about a spouting whale Would you call him Willie Nah too obvious Wilhelm now  that had a fine round ring to it simultaneously grand and amusing Wilhelm the Spouting Whale I remember the bang of thunder from overhead I remember how happy I was with the decision finally made and the night to look forward to I remember the murmur of mens voices and the murmur of Matties response as she told them where to put the stuff Then I heard all of them going back out again I looked down at myself and saw a certain lump was subsiding I remember thinking there was nothing so absurdlooking as a sexually excited man and knew Id had this same thought before perhaps in a dream I left the bathroom checked on Kyra again  rolled over on her side fast asleep  and then went down the hall I had just reached the living room when gunfire erupted outside I never confused the sound with thunder There was a moment when my mind fumbled toward the idea of backfires  some kids hotrod  and then I knew Part of me had been expecting something to happen    but it had been expecting ghosts rather than gunfire A fatal lapse It was the rapid pah pah pah of an autofire weapon  a Glock ninemillimeter as it turned out Mattie screamed  a high drilling scream that froze my blood I heard John cry out in pain and George Kennedy bellow Down down For the love of Christ get her down Something hit the trailer like a hard spatter of hail  a rattle of punching sounds running from west to east Something split the air in front of my eyes  I heard it There was an almostmusical sproing sound like a snapping guitar string On the kitchen table the salad bowl one of them had just brought in shattered I ran for the door and nearly dived down the cementblock steps I saw the barbecue overturned with the glowing coals already setting patches of the scant frontyard grass on fire I saw Rommie Bissonette sitting with his legs outstretched looking stupidly down at his ankle which was soaked with blood Mattie was on her hands and knees by the barbecue with her hair hanging in her face  it was as if she meant to sweep up the hot coals before they could cause some real trouble John staggered toward me holding out a hand The arm above it was soaked with blood And I saw the car Id seen before  the nondescript sedan with the joke sticker on it It had gone up the road  the men inside making that first pass to check us out  then turned around and come back The shooter was still leaning out the front passenger window I could see the stubby smoking weapon in his hands It had a wire stock His features were a blue blank broken only by huge gaping eyesockets  a skimask Overhead thunder gave a long awakening roar George Kennedy was walking toward the car not hurrying kicking hot spilled coals out of his way as he went not bothering about the darkred stain that was spreading on the right thigh of his pants reaching behind himself not hurrying even when the shooter pulled back in and shouted Go go go at the driver who was also wearing a blue mask George not hurrying no not hurrying a bit and even before I saw the pistol in his hand I knew why he had never taken off his absurd Pa Kettle suit jacket why he had even played Frisbee in it The blue car it turned out to be a  Ford registered to Mrs Sonia Belliveau of Auburn and reported stolen the day before had pulled over onto the shoulder and had never really stopped rolling Now it accelerated spewing dry brown dust out from under its rear tires fishtailing knocking Matties RFD box off its post and sending it flying into the road George still didnt hurry He brought his hands together holding his gun with his right and steadying with his left He squeezed off five deliberate shots The first two went into the trunk  I saw the holes appear The third blew in the back window of the departing Ford and I heard someone shout in pain The fourth went I dont know where The fifth blew the left rear tire The Ford veered to that side The driver almost brought it back then lost it completely The car ploughed into the ditch thirty yards below Matties trailer and rolled over on its side There was a whumpf and the rear end was engulfed in flames One of Georges shots must have hit the gastank The shooter began struggling to get out through the passenger window Ki    get Ki    away     A hoarse whispering voice Mattie was crawling toward me One side of her head  the right side  still looked all right but the left side was a ruin One dazed blue eye peered out from between clumps of bloody hair Skullfragments littered her tanned shoulder like bits of broken crockery How I would love to tell you I dont remember any of this how I would love to have someone else tell you that Michael Noonan died before he saw that but I cannot Alas is the word for it in the crossword puzzles a fourletter word meaning to express great sorrow Ki    Mike get Ki     I knelt and put my arms around her She struggled against me She was young and strong and even with the gray matter of her brain bulging through the broken wall of her skull she struggled against me crying for her daughter wanting to reach her and protect her and get her to safety Mattie its all right I said Down at the Grace Baptist Church at the far end of the zone I was in they were singing Blessed Assurance    but most of their eyes were as blank as the eye now peering at me through the tangle of bloody hair Mattie stop rest its all right Ki    get Ki    dont let them     They wont hurt her Mattie I promise She slid against me slippery as a fish and screamed her daughters name holding out her bloody hands toward the trailer The rosecolored shorts and top had gone bright red Blood spattered the grass as she thrashed and pulled From down the hill there was a guttural explosion as the Fords gastank exploded Black smoke rose toward a black sky Thunder roared long and loud as if the sky were saying You want noise Yeah Ill give you noise Say Matties all right Mike John cried in a wavering voice Oh for Gods sake say shes   He dropped to his knees beside me his eyes rolling up until nothing showed but the whites He reached for me grabbed my shoulder then tore damned near half my shirt off as he lost his battle to stay conscious and fell on his side next to Mattie A curd of white goo bubbled from one corner of his mouth Twelve feet away near the overturned barbecue Rommie was trying to get on his feet his teeth clenched in pain George was standing in the middle of Wasp Hill Road reloading his gun from a pouch hed apparently had in his coat pocket and watching as the shooter worked to get clear of the overturned car before it was engulfed The entire right leg of Georges pants was red now He may live but hell never wear that suit again I thought I held Mattie I put my face down to hers put my mouth to the ear that was still there and said Kyras okay Shes sleeping Shes fine I promise Mattie seemed to understand She stopped straining against me and collapsed to the grass trembling all over Ki    Ki     This was the last of her talking on earth One of her hands reached out blindly groped at a tuft of grass and yanked it out Over here I heard George saying Get over here motherfuck dont you even think about turning your back on me How bad is she Rommie asked hobbling over His face was as white as paper And before I could reply Oh Jesus Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus Oh Mary born without sin pray for us who have recourse to Thee Oh no oh Mike no He began again this time lapsing into Lewiston streetFrench what the old folks call La Parle Quit it I said and he did It was as if he had only been waiting to be told Go inside and check on Kyra Can you Yes He started toward the trailer holding his leg and lurching along With each lurch he gave a high yip of pain but somehow he kept going I could smell burning tufts of grass I could smell electric rain on a rising wind And under my hands I could feel the light spin of the dreidel slowing down as she went I turned her over held her in my arms and rocked her back and forth At Grace Baptist the minister was now reading Psalm  for Royce If I say Surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light The minister was reading and the Martians were listening I rocked her back and forth in my arms under the black thunderheads I was supposed to come to her that night use the key under the pot and come to her She had danced with the toes of her white sneakers on the red Frisbee had danced like a wave on the ocean and now she was dying in my arms while the grass burned in little clumps and the man who had fancied her as much as I had lay unconscious beside her his right arm painted red from the short sleeve of his WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS teeshirt all the way down to his bony freckled wrist Mattie I said Mattie Mattie Mattie I rocked her and smoothed my hand across her forehead which on the right side was miraculously unsplattered by the blood that had drenched her Her hair fell over the ruined left side of her face Mattie I said Mattie Mattie oh Mattie Lightning flashed  the first stroke I had seen It lit the western sky in a bright blue arc Mattie trembled strongly in my arms  all the way from neck to toes she trembled Her lips pressed together Her brow furrowed as if in concentration Her hand came up and seemed to grab for the back of my neck as a person falling from a cliff may grasp blindly at anything to hold on just a little longer Then it fell away and lay limply on the grass palm up She trembled once more  the whole delicate weight of her trembled in my arms  and then she was still After that I was mostly in the zone I came out a few times when that scratchedout scrap of genealogy fell from inside one of my old steno books for instance  but those interludes were brief In a way it was like my dream of Mattie Jo and Sara in a way it was like the terrible fever Id had as a child when Id almost died of the measles mostly it was like nothing but itself It was just the zone I was feeling it I wish to God I hadnt been George came over herding the man in the blue mask ahead of him George was limping now and badly I could smell hot oil and gasoline and burning tires Is she dead George asked Mattie Yes John Dont know I said and then John twitched and groaned He was alive but there was a lot of blood Mike listen George began but before he could say more a terrible liquid screaming began from the burning car in the ditch It was the driver He was cooking in there The shooter started to turn that way and George raised his gun Move and Ill kill you You cant let him die like that the shooter said from behind his mask You couldnt let a dog die like that Hes dead already George said You couldnt get within ten feet of that car unless you were in an asbestos suit He reeled on his feet His face was as white as the spot of whipped cream Id wiped off the end of Kis nose The shooter made as if to go for him and George brought the gun up higher The next time you move dont stop George said because I wont Guaranteed Now take that mask off No Im done fucking with you Jesse Say hello to God George pulled back the hammer of his revolver The shooter said Jesus Christ and yanked off his mask It was George Footman Not much surprise there From behind him the driver gave one more shriek from within the Ford fireball and then was silent Smoke rose in black billows More thunder roared Mike go inside and find something to tie him with George Kennedy said I can hold him another minute  two if I have to  but Im bleeding like a stuck pig Look for strapping tape That shit would hold Houdini Footman stood where he was looking from Kennedy to me and back to Kennedy again Then he peered down at Highway  which was eerily deserted Or perhaps it wasnt so eerie at that  the coming storms had been well forecast The tourists and summer folk would be under cover As for the locals    The locals were    sort of listening That was at least close The minister was speaking about Royce Merrill a life which had been long and fruitful a man who had served his country in peace and in war but the oldtimers werent listening to him They were listening to us the way they had once gathered around the pickle barrel at the Lakeview General and listened to prizefights on the radio Bill Dean was holding Yvettes wrist so tightly his fingernails were white He was hurting her    but she wasnt complaining She wanted him to hold onto her Why Mike Georges voice was perceptibly weaker Please man help me This guy is dangerous Let me go Footman said Youd better dont you think In your wettest dreams motherfuck George said I got up went past the pot with the key underneath went up the cementblock steps Lightning exploded across the sky followed by a bellow of thunder Inside Rommie was sitting in a chair at the kitchen table His face was even whiter than Georges Kids okay he said forcing the words But she looks like waking up    I cant walk anymore My ankles totally fucked I moved for the telephone Dont bother Rommie said His voice was harsh and trembling Tried it Dead Storm must already have hit some of the other towns Killed some of the equipment Christ I never had anything hurt like this in my life I went to the drawers in the kitchen and began yanking them open one by one looking for strapping tape looking for clothesline looking for any damned thing If Kennedy passed out from bloodloss while I was in here the other George would take his gun kill him and then kill John as he lay unconscious on the smoldering grass With them taken care of hed come in here and shoot Rommie and me Hed finish with Kyra No he wont I said Hell leave her alive And that might be even worse Silverware in the first drawer Sandwich bags garbage bags and neatly banded stacks of grocerystore coupons in the second Oven mitts and potholders in the third  Mike wheres my Mattie I turned as guilty as a man who has been caught mixing illegal drugs Kyra stood at the livingroom end of the hall with her hair falling around her sleepflushed cheeks and her scrunchy hung over one wrist like a bracelet Her eyes were wide and panicky It wasnt the shots that had awakened her probably not even her mothers scream I had wakened her My thoughts had wakened her In the instant I realized it I tried to shield them somehow but I was too late She had read me about Devore well enough to tell me not to think about sad stuff and now she read what had happened to her mother before I could keep her out of my mind Her mouth dropped open Her eyes widened She shrieked as if her hand had been caught in a vise and ran for the door No Kyra no I sprinted across the kitchen almost tripping over Rommie he looked at me with the dim incomprehension of someone who is no longer completely conscious and grabbed her just in time As I did I saw Buddy Jellison leaving Grace Baptist by a side door Two of the men he had been smoking with went with him Now I understood why Bill was holding so tightly to Yvette and loved him for it  loved both of them Something wanted him to go with Buddy and the others    but Bill wasnt going Kyra struggled in my arms making big convulsive thrusts at the door gasping in breath and then screaming it out again Let me go want to see Mommy let me go want to see Mommy let me go   I called her name with the only voice I knew she would really hear the one I could use only with her She relaxed in my arms little by little and turned to me Her eyes were huge and confused and shining with tears She looked at me a moment longer and then seemed to understand that she mustnt go out I put her down She just stood there a moment then backed up until her bottom was against the dishwasher She slid down its smooth white front to the floor Then she began to wail  the most awful sounds of grief I have ever heard She understood completely you see I had to show her enough to keep her inside I had to    and because we were in the zone together I could Buddy and his friends were in a pickup truck headed this way BAMM CONSTRUCTION it said on the side Mike George cried He sounded panicky You got to hurry Hold on I called back Hold on George Mattie and the others had started stacking picnic things beside the sink but Im almost positive that the stretch of Formica counter above the drawers had been clean and bare when I hurried after Kyra Not now The yellow sugar cannister had been overturned Written in the spilled sugar was this No shit I muttered and checked the remaining drawers No tape no rope Not even a lousy set of handcuffs and in most wellequipped kitchens you can count on finding three or four Then I had an idea and looked in the cabinet under the sink When I went back out our George was swaying on his feet and Footman was looking at him with a kind of predatory concentration Did you get some tape George Kennedy asked No something better I said Tell me Footman who actually paid you Devore or Whitmore Or dont you know Fuck you he said I had my right hand behind my back Now I pointed down the hill with my left one and endeavored to look surprised What the hells Osgood doing Tell him to go away Footman looked in that direction  it was instinctive  and I hit him in the back of the head with the Craftsman hammer Id found in the toolbox under Matties sink The sound was horrible the spray of blood erupting from the flying hair was horrible but worst of all was the feeling of the skull giving way  a spongy collapse that came right up the handle and into my fingers He went down like a sandbag and I dropped the hammer gagging Okay George said A little ugly but probably the best thing you could have done under    under the     He didnt go down like Footman  it was slower and more controlled almost graceful  but he was just as out I picked up the revolver looked at it then threw it into the woods across the road A gun was nothing for me to have right now it could only get me into more trouble A couple of other men had also left the church a carful of ladies in black dresses and veils as well I had to hurry on even faster I unbuckled Georges pants and pulled them down The bullet which had taken him in the leg had torn into his thigh but the wound looked as if it was clotting Johns upper arm was a different story  it was still pumping out blood in frightening quantities I yanked his belt free and cinched it around his arm as tightly as I could Then I slapped him across the face His eyes opened and stared at me with a bleary lack of recognition Open your mouth John He only stared at me I leaned down until our noses were almost touching and screamed OPEN YOUR MOUTH DO IT NOW He opened it like a kid when the nurse tells him just say aahh I stuck the end of the belt between his teeth Close He closed Now hold it I said Even if you pass out hold it I didnt have time to see if he was paying attention I got to my feet and looked up as the whole world went glareblue For a second it was like being inside a neon sign There was a black suspended river up there roiling and coiling like a basket of snakes I had never seen such a baleful sky I dashed up the cementblock steps and into the trailer again Rommie had slumped forward onto the table with his face in his folded arms He would have looked like a kindergartner taking a timeout if not for the broken salad bowl and the bits of lettuce in his hair Kyra still sat with her back to the dishwasher weeping hysterically I picked her up and realized that she had wet herself We have to go now Ki I want Mattie I want Mommy I want my Mattie make her stop being hurt Make her stop being dead I hurried across the trailer On the way to the door I passed the endtable with the Mary Higgins Clark novel on it I noticed the tangle of hair ribbons again  ribbons perhaps tried on before the party and then discarded in favor of the scrunchy They were white with bright red edges Pretty I picked them up without stopping stuffed them into a pants pocket then switched Ki to my other arm I want Mattie I want Mommy Make her come back She swatted at me trying to make me stop then began to buck and kick in my arms again She drummed her fists on the side of my head Put me down Land me Land me No Kyra Put me down Land me Land me PUT ME DOWN I was losing her Then as we came out onto the top step she abruptly stopped struggling Give me Stricken I want Stricken At first I had no idea what she was talking about but when I looked where she was pointing I understood Lying on the walk not far from the pot with the key underneath it was the stuffed toy from Kis Happy Meal Strickland had put in a fair amount of outside playtime from the look of him  the lightgray fur was now darkgray with dust  but if the toy would calm her I wanted her to have it This was no time to worry about dirt and germs Ill give you Strickland if you promise to close your eyes and not open them until I tell you Will you promise I promise she said She was trembling in my arms and great globular tears  the kind you expect to see in fairytale books never in real life  rose in her eyes and went spilling down her cheeks I could smell burning grass and charred beefsteak For one terrible moment I thought I was going to vomit and then I got it under control Ki closed her eyes Two more tears fell from them and onto my arm They were hot She held out one hand groping I went down the steps got the dog then hesitated First the ribbons now the dog The ribbons were probably okay but it seemed wrong to give her the dog and let her bring it along It seemed wrong but    Its gray Irish the UFO voice whispered You dont need to worry about it because its gray The stuffed toy in your dream was black I didnt know exactly what the voice was talking about and had no time to care I put the stuffed dog in Kyras open hand She held it up to her face and kissed the dusty fur her eyes still closed Maybe Stricken can make Mommy better Mike Stricken a magic dog Just keep your eyes closed Dont open them until I say She put her face against my neck I carried her across the yard and to my car that way I put her on the passenger side of the front seat She lay down with her arms over her head and the dirty stuffed dog clutched in one pudgy hand I told her to stay just like that lying down on the seat She made no outward sign that she heard me but I knew that she did We had to hurry because the oldtimers were coming The oldtimers wanted this business over wanted this river to run into the sea And there was only one place we could go only one place where we might be safe and that was Sara Laughs But there was something I had to do first I kept a blanket in the trunk old but clean I took it out walked across the yard and shook it down over Mattie Devore The hump it made as it settled around her was pitifully slight I looked around and saw John staring at me His eyes were glassy with shock but I thought maybe he was coming back The belt was still clamped in his teeth he looked like a junkie preparing to shoot up Iss ant eee he said  This cant be I knew exactly how he felt Therell be help here in just a few minutes Hang in there I have to go Go air I didnt answer There wasnt time I stopped and took George Kennedys pulse Slow but strong Beside him Footman was deep in unconsciousness but muttering thickly Nowhere near dead It takes a lot to kill a daddy The jerky wind blew the smoke from the overturned car in my direction and now I could smell cooking flesh as well as barbecued steak My stomach clenched again I ran to the Chevy dropped behind the wheel and backed out of the driveway I took one more look  at the blanketcovered body at the three knockedover men at the trailer with the line of black bulletholes wavering down its side and its door standing open John was up on his good elbow the end of the belt still clamped in his teeth looking at me with uncomprehending eyes Lightning flashed so brilliantly I tried to shield my eyes from it although by the time my hand was up the flash had gone and the day was as dark as late dusk Stay down Ki I said Just like you are I cant hear you she said in a voice so hoarse and choked with tears that I could barely make out the words Kis takin a nap wif Stricken Okay I said Good I drove past the burning Ford and down to the foot of the hill where I stopped at the rusty bulletpocked stopsign I looked right and saw the pickup truck parked on the shoulder BAMM CONSTRUCTION on the side Three men crowded together in the cab watching me The one by the passenger window was Buddy Jellison I could tell him by his hat Very slowly and deliberately I raised my right hand and gave them the finger None of them responded and their stony faces didnt change but the pickup began to roll slowly toward me I turned lift onto  heading for Sara Laughs under a black sky Two miles from where Lane Fortytwo branches off the highway and winds west to the lake there stood an old abandoned barn upon which one could still make out faded letters reading DONCASTER DAIRY As we approached it the whole eastern side of the sky lit up in a purplewhite blister I cried out and the Chevys horn honked  by itself Im almost positive A thorn of lightning grew from the bottom of that lightblister and struck the barn For a moment it was still completely there glowing like something radioactive and then it spewed itself in all directions I have never seen anything even remotely like it outside of a movie theater The thunderclap which followed was like a bombshell Kyra screamed and slid onto the floor on the passenger side of the car with her hands clapped to her ears She still clutched the little stuffed dog in one of them A minute later I topped Sugar Ridge Lane Fortytwo splits left from the highway at the bottom of the ridges north slope From the top I could see a wide swath of TR  woods and fields and barns and farms even a darkling gleam from the lake The sky was as black as coal dust flashing almost constantly with internal lightnings The air had a clear ochre glow Every breath I took tasted like the shavings in a tinderbox The topography beyond the ridge stood out with a surreal clarity I cannot forget That sense of mystery swarmed my heart and mind that sense of the world as thin skin over unknowable bones and gulfs I glanced into the rearview mirror and saw that the pickup truck had been joined by two other cars one with a Vplate that means the vehicle is registered to a combat veteran of the armed services When I slowed down they slowed down When I sped up they sped up I doubted they would follow us any farther once I turned onto Lane Fortytwo however Ki Are you okay Sleepun she said from the footwell Okay I said and started down the hill I could just see the red bicycle reflectors marking my turn onto Fortytwo when it began to hail  great big chunks of white ice that fell out of the sky drummed on the roof like heavy fingers and bounced off the hood They began to heap in the gutter where my windshield wipers hid Whats happening Kyra cried Its just hail I said It cant hurt us This was barely out of my mouth when a hailstone the size of a small lemon struck my side of the windshield and then bounced high into the air again leaving a white II mark from which a number of short cracks radiated Were John and George Kennedy lying helpless out in this I turned my mind in that direction but could sense nothing When I made the left onto Lane Fortytwo it was hailing almost too hard to see The wheelruts were heaped with ice The white faded out under the trees though I headed for that cover flipping on my headlights as I went They cut bright cones through the pelting hail As we went into the trees that purplewhite blister glowed again and my rearview mirror went too bright to look at There was a rending crackling crash Kyra screamed again I looked around and saw a huge old spruce toppling slowly across the lane its ragged stump on fire It carried the electrical lines with it Blocked in I thought This end probably the other end too Were here For better or for worse were here The trees grew over Lane Fortytwo in a canopy except for where the road passed beside Tidwells Meadow The sound of the hail in the woods was an immense splintery rattle Trees were splintering of course it was the most damaging hail ever to fall in that part of the world and although it spent itself in fifteen minutes that was long enough to ruin a seasons worth of crops Lightning flashed above us I looked up and saw a large orange fireball being chased by a smaller one They ran through the trees to our left setting fire to some of the high branches We came briefly into the clear at Tidwells Meadow and as we did the hail changed to torrential rain I could not have continued driving if we hadnt run back into the woods almost immediately and as it was the canopy provided just enough cover so I could creep along hunched over the wheel and peering into the silver curtain falling through the fan of my headlights Thunder boomed constantly and now the wind began to rise rushing through the trees like a contentious voice Ahead of me a leafheavy branch dropped into the road I ran over it and listened to it thunk and scrape and roll against the Chevys undercarriage Please nothing bigger I thought    or maybe I was praying Please let me get to the house Please let us get to the house By the time I reached the driveway the wind was howling a hurricane The writhing trees and pelting rain made the entire world seem on the verge of wavering into insubstantial gruel The driveways slope had turned into a river but I nosed the Chevy down it with no hesitation  we couldnt stay out here if a big tree fell on the car wed be crushed like bugs in a Dixie cup I knew better than to use the brakes  the car would have heeled sideways and perhaps have been swept right down the slope toward the lake rolling over and over as it went Instead I dropped the transmission into low range toed two notches into the emergency brake and let the engine pull us down with the rain sheeting against the windshield and turning the log bulk of the house into a phantom Incredibly some of the lights were still on shining like bathysphere portholes in nine feet of water The generator was working then    at least for the time being Lightning threw a lance across the lake greenblue fire illuminating a black well of water with its surface lashed into surging whitecaps One of the hundredyearold pines which had stood to the left of the railroadtie steps now lay with half its length in the water Somewhere behind us another tree went over with a vast crash Kyra covered her ears Its all right honey I said Were here we made it I turned off the engine and killed the lights Without them I could see little almost all the day had gone out of the day I tried to open my door and at first couldnt I pushed harder and it not only opened it was ripped right out of my hand I got out and in a brilliant stroke of lightning saw Kyra crawling across the seat toward me her face white with panic her eyes huge and brimming with terror My door swung back and hit me in the ass hard enough to hurt I ignored it gathered Ki into my arms and turned with her Cold rain drenched us both in an instant Except it really wasnt like rain at all it was like stepping under a waterfall My doggy Ki shrieked Shriek or not I could hardly hear her I could see her face though and her empty hands Stricken I drop Stricken I looked around and yes there he was floating down the macadam of the driveway and past the stoop A little farther on the rushing water spilled off the paving and down the slope if Strickland went with the flow hed probably end up in the woods somewhere Or all the way down to the lake Stricken Ki sobbed My DOGGY Suddenly nothing mattered to either of us but that stupid stuffed toy I chased down the driveway after it with Ki in my arms oblivious of the rain and wind and brilliant flashes of lightning And yet it was going to beat me to the slope  the water in which it was caught was running too fast for me to catch up What snagged it at the edge of the paving was a trio of sunflowers waving wildly in the wind They looked like Godtransported worshippers at a revival meeting Yes Jeesus Thankya Lawd They also looked familiar It was of course impossible that they should be the same three sunflowers which had been growing up through the boards of the stoop in my dream and in the photograph Bill Dean had taken before I came back and yet it was them beyond doubt it was them Three sunflowers like the three weird sisters in Macbeth three sunflowers with faces like searchlights I had come back to Sara Laughs I was in the zone I had returned to my dream and this time it had possessed me Stricken Ki bending and thrashing in my arms both of us too slippery for safety Please Mike please Thunder exploded overhead like a basket of nitro We both screamed I dropped to one knee and snatched up the little stuffed dog Kyra clutched it covered it with frantic kisses I lurched to my feet as another thunderclap sounded this one seeming to run through the air like some crazy liquid bullwhip I looked at the sunflowers and they seemed to look back at me  Hello Irish its been a long time what do you say Then resettling Ki in my arms as well as I could I turned and slogged for the house It wasnt easy the water in the driveway was now ankledeep and full of melting hailstones A branch flew past us and landed pretty much where Id knelt to pick up Strickland There was a crash and a series of thuds as a bigger branch struck the roof and went rolling down it I ran onto the back stoop halfexpecting the Shape to come rushing out to greet us raising its baggy notarms in gruesome good fellowship but there was no Shape There was only the storm and that was enough Ki was clutching the dog tightly and I saw with no surprise at all that its wetting combined with the dirt from all those hours of outside play had turned Strickland black It was what I had seen in my dream after all Too late now There was nowhere else to go no other shelter from the storm I opened the door and brought Kyra Devore inside Sara Laughs The central portion of Sara  the heart of the house  had stood for almost a hundred years and had seen its share of storms The one that fell on the lakes region that July afternoon might have been the worst of them but I knew as soon as we were inside both of us gasping like people who have narrowly escaped drowning that it would almost certainly withstand this one as well The log walls were so thick it was almost like stepping into some sort of vault The storms crash and bash became a noisy drone punctuated by thunderclaps and the occasional loud thud of a branch falling on the roof Somewhere  in the basement I guess  a door had come loose and was clapping back and forth It sounded like a starters pistol The kitchen window had been broken by the topple of a small tree Its needly tip poked in over the stove making shadows on the counter and the stoveburners as it swayed I thought of breaking it off and decided not to At least it was plugging the hole I carried Ki into the living room and we looked out at the lake black water prinked up in surreal points under a black sky Lightning flashed almost constantly revealing a ring of woods that danced and swayed in a frenzy all around the lake As solid as the house was it was groaning deeply within itself as the wind pummelled it and tried to push it down the hill There was a soft steady chiming Kyra lifted her head from my shoulder and looked around You have a moose she said Yes thats Bunter Does he bite No honey he cant bite Hes like a    like a doll I suppose Why is his bell ringing Hes glad were here Hes glad we made it I saw her want to be happy and then I saw her realizing that Mattie wasnt here to be happy with I saw the idea that Mattie would never be here to be happy with glimmer in her mind    and felt her push it away Over our heads something huge crashed down on the roof the lights flickered and Ki began to weep again No honey I said and began to walk with her No honey no Ki dont Dont honey dont I want my mommy I want my Mattie I walked her the way I think youre supposed to walk babies who have colic She understood too much for a threeyearold and her suffering was consequently more terrible than any threeyearold should have to bear So I held her in my arms and walked her her shorts damp with urine and rainwater under my hands her arms feverhot around my neck her cheeks slathered with snot and tears her hair a soaked clump from our brief dash through the downpour her breath acetone her toy a strangulated black clump that sent dirty water trickling over her knuckles I walked her Back and forth we went through Saras living room back and forth through dim light thrown by the overhead and one lamp Generator light is never quite steady never quite still  it seems to breathe and sigh Back and forth through the ceaseless low chiming of Bunters bell like music from that world we sometimes touch but never really see Back and forth beneath the sound of the storm I think I sang to her and I know I touched her with my mind and we went deeper and deeper into that zone together Above us the clouds ran and the rain pelted dousing the fires the lightning had started in the woods The house groaned and the air eddied with gusts coming in through the broken kitchen window but through it all there was a feeling of rueful safety A feeling of coming home At last her tears began to taper off She lay with her cheek and the weight of her heavy head on my shoulder and when we passed the lakeside windows I could see her eyes looking out into the silverdark storm wide and unblinking Carrying her was a tall man with thinning hair I realized I could see the diningroom table right through us Our reflections are ghosts already I thought Ki Can you eat something Not hungy Can you drink a glass of milk No cocoa I cold Yes of course you are And I have cocoa I tried to put her down and she held on with panicky tightness scrambling against me with her plump little thighs I hoisted her back up again this time settling her against my hip and she subsided Whos here she asked She had begun to shiver Whos here sides us I dont know Theres a boy she said I saw him there She pointed Strickland toward the sliding glass door which gave on the deck all the chairs out there had been overturned and thrown into the corners one of the set was missing apparently blown right over the rail He was black like on that funny show me and Mattie watch There are other black people too A lady in a big hat A man in blue pants The rest are hard to see But they watch They watch us Dont you see them They cant hurt us Are you sure Are you are you I didnt answer I found a box of Swiss Miss hiding behind the flour cannister tore open one of the packets and dumped it into a cup Thunder exploded overhead Ki jumped in my arms and let out a long miserable wail I hugged her kissed her cheek Dont put me down Mike I scared I wont put you down Youre my good girl I scared of the boy and the bluepants man and the lady I think its the lady who wore Matties dress Are they ghosties Yes Are they bad like the men who chased us at the fair Are they I dont really know Ki and thats the truth But well find out Huh Thats what you thought But well find out  Yes I said I guess thats what I was thinking Something like that I took her down to the master bedroom while the water heated in the kettle thinking there had to be something left of Jos I could pop her into but all of the drawers in Jos bureau were empty So was her side of the closet I stood Ki on the big double bed where I had not so much as taken a nap since coming back took off her clothes carried her into the bathroom and wrapped her in a bathtowel She hugged it around herself shaking and bluelipped I used another one to dry her hair as best I could During all of this she never let go of the stuffed dog which was now beginning to bleed stuffing from its seams I opened the medicine cabinet pawed through it and found what I was looking for on the top shelf the Benadryl Jo had kept around for her ragweed allergy I thought of checking the expiration date on the bottom of the box then almost laughed out loud What difference did that make I stood Ki on the closed toilet seat and let her hold on around my neck while I stripped the childproof backing from four of the little pinkandwhite caplets Then I rinsed out the toothglass and filled it with cold water While I was doing this I saw movement in the bathroom mirror which reflected the doorway and the master bedroom beyond I told myself that I was only seeing the shadows of windblown trees I offered the caplets to Ki She reached for them then hesitated Go on I said Its medicine What kind she asked Her small hand was still poised over the little cluster of caplets Sadness medicine I said Can you swallow pills Ki Sure I taught myself when I was two She hesitated a moment longer  looking at me and looking into me I think ascertaining that I was telling her something I really believed What she saw or felt must have satisfied her because she took the caplets and put them in her mouth one after another She swallowed them with little birdiesips from the glass then said I still feel sad Mike It takes awhile for them to work I rummaged in my shirt drawer and found an old HarleyDavidson tee that had shrunk It was still miles too big for her but when I tied a knot in one side it made a kind of sarong that kept slipping off one of her shoulders It was almost cute I carry a comb in my back pocket I took it out and combed her hair back from her forehead and her temples She was starting to look put together again but there was still something missing Something that was connected in my mind with Royce Merrill That was crazy though    wasnt it Mike What cane What cane are you thinking about it Then it came to me A candy cane I said The kind with stripes From my pocket I took the two white ribbons Their red edges looked almost raw in the uncertain light Like these I tied her hair back in two little ponytails Now she had her ribbons she had her black dog the sunflowers had relocated a few feet north but they were there Everything was more or less the way it was supposed to be Thunder blasted somewhere close a tree fell and the lights went out After five seconds of darkgray shadows they came on again I carried Ki back to the kitchen and when we passed the cellar door something laughed behind it I heard it Ki did too I could see it in her eyes Take care of me she said Take care of me cause Im just a little guy You promised I will I love you Mike I love you too Ki The kettle was huffing I filled the cup to the halfway mark with hot water then topped it up with milk cooling it off and making it richer I took Kyra over to the couch As we passed the diningroom table I glanced at the IBM typewriter and at the manuscript with the crosswordpuzzle book lying on top of it Those things looked vaguely foolish and somehow sad like gadgets that never worked very well and now do not work at all Lightning lit up the entire sky scouring the room with purple light In that glare the laboring trees looked like screaming fingers and as the light raced across the sliding glass door to the deck I saw a woman standing behind us by the woodstove She was indeed wearing a straw hat with a brim the size of a cartwheel What do you mean the river is almost in the sea Ki asked I sat down and handed her the cup Drink that up Why did the men hurt my mommy Didnt they want her to have a good time I guess not I said I began to cry I held her on my lap wiping away the tears with the backs of my hands You should have taken some sadpills too Ki said She held out her cocoa Her hair ribbons which I had tied in big sloppy bows bobbed Here Drink some I drank some From the north end of the house came another grinding crackling crash The low rumble of the generator stuttered and the house went gray again Shadows raced across Kis small face Hold on I told her Try not to be scared Maybe the lights will come back A moment later they did although now I could hear a hoarse uneven note in the gennies roar and the flicker of the lights was much more noticeable Tell me a story she said Tell me about Cinderbell Cinderella Yeah her All right but storyguys get paid I pursed my lips and made sipping sounds She held the cup out The cocoa was sweet and good The sensation of being watched was heavy and not sweet at all but let them watch Let them watch while they could There was this pretty girl named Cinderella   Once upon a time Thats how it starts Thats how they all start Thats right I forgot Once upon a time there was this pretty girl named Cinderella who had two mean stepsisters Their names were    do you remember Tammy Faye and Vanna Yeah the Queens of Hairspray And they made Cinderella do all the really unpleasant chores like sweeping out the fireplace and cleaning up the dogpoop in the back yard Now it just so happened that the noted rock band Oasis was going to play a gig at the palace and although all the girls had been invited     I got as far as the part about the fairy godmother catching the mice and turning them into a Mercedes limousine before the Benadryl took effect It really was a medicine for sadness when I looked down Ki was fast asleep in the crook of my arm with her cocoa cup listing radically to port I plucked it from her fingers and put it on the coffeetable then brushed her drying hair off her forehead Ki Nothing Shed gone to the land of NoddyBlinky It probably helped that her afternoon nap had ended almost before it got started I picked her up and carried her down to the north bedroom her feet bouncing limply in the air and the hem of the Harley shirt flipping around her knees I put her on the bed and pulled the duvet up to her chin Thunder boomed like artillery fire but she didnt even stir Exhaustion grief Benadryl    they had taken her deep taken her beyond ghosts and sorrow and that was good I bent over and kissed her cheek which had finally begun to cool Ill take care of you I said I promised and I will As if hearing me Ki turned on her side put the hand holding Strickland under her jaw and made a soft sighing sound Her lashes were dark soot against her cheeks in startling contrast to her light hair Looking at her I felt myself swept by love shaken by it the way one is shaken by a sickness Take care of me Im just a little guy I will Kibird I said I went into the bathroom and began filling the tub as I had once filled it in my sleep She would sleep through it all if I could get enough warm water before the generator quit entirely I wished I had a bathtoy to give her in case she did wake up something like Wilhelm the Spouting Whale but shed have her dog and she probably wouldnt wake up anyway No freezing baptism under a handpump for Kyra I was not cruel and I was not crazy I had only disposable razors in the medicine cabinet no good for the other job ahead of me Not efficient enough But one of the kitchen steak knives would do If I filled the washbasin with water that was really hot I wouldnt even feel it A letter T on each arm the top bar drawn across the wrists  For a moment I came out of the zone A voice  my own speaking as some combination of Jo and Mattie  screamed What are you thinking about Oh Mike what in Gods name are you thinking about Then the thunder boomed the lights flickered and the rain began to pour down again driven by the wind I went back into that place where everything was clear my course indisputable Let it all end  the sorrow the hurt the fear I didnt want to think anymore about how Mattie had danced with her toes on the Frisbee as if it were a spotlight I didnt want to be there when Kyra woke up didnt want to see the misery fill her eyes I didnt want to get through the night ahead the day that was coming beyond it or the day that was coming after that They were all cars on the same old mystery train Life was a sickness I was going to give her a nice warm bath and cure her of it I raised my arms In the medicine cabinet mirror a murky figure  a Shape  raised its own in a kind of jocular greeting It was me It had been me all along and that was all right That was just fine I dropped to one knee and checked the water It was coming in nice and warm Good Even if the generator quit now it would be fine The tub was an old one a deep one As I walked down to the kitchen to get the knife I thought about climbing in with her after I had finished cutting my wrists in the hotter water of the basin No I decided It might be misinterpreted by the people who would come here later on people with nasty minds and nastier assumptions The ones whod come when the storm was over and the trees across the road cleared away No after her bath I would dry her and put her back in bed with Strickland in her hand Id sit across the room from her in the rocking chair by the bedroom windows I would spread some towels in my lap to keep as much of the blood off my pants as I could and eventually I would go to sleep too Bunters bell was still ringing Much louder now It was getting on my nerves and if it kept on that way it might even wake the baby I decided to pull it down and silence it for good I crossed the room and as I did a strong gust of air blew past me It wasnt a draft from the broken kitchen window this was that warm subwayair again It blew the Tough Stuff crossword book onto the floor but the paperweight on the manuscript kept the loose pages from following As I looked in that direction Bunters bell fell silent A voice sighed across the dim room Words I couldnt make out And what did they matter What did one more manifestation  one more blast of hot air from the Great Beyond  matter Thunder rolled and the sigh came again This time as the generator died and the lights went out plunging the room into gray shadow I got one word in the clear Nineteen I turned on my heels making a nearly complete circle I finished up looking across the shadowy room at the manuscript of My Childhood Friend Suddenly the light broke Understanding arrived Not the crossword book Not the phone book either My book My manuscript I crossed to it vaguely aware that the water had stopped running into the tub in the northwing bathroom When the generator died the pump had quit That was all right it would be plenty deep enough already And warm I would give Kyra her bath but first there was something I had to do I had to go down nineteen and after that I just might have to go down ninetytwo And I could I had completed just over a hundred and twenty pages of manuscript so I could I grabbed the batterypowered lantern from the top of the cabinet where I still kept several hundred actual vinyl records clicked it on and set it on the table It cast a white circle of radiance on the manuscript  in the gloom of that afternoon it was as bright as a spotlight On page nineteen of My Childhood Friend Tiffi Taylor  the callgirl who had reinvented herself as Regina Whiting  was sitting in her studio with Andy Drake reliving the day that John Sanborn the alias under which John Shackleford had been getting by saved her threeyearold daughter Karen This is the passage I read as the thunder boomed and the rain slashed against the sliding door giving on the deck FRIEND by NoonanPg  over that way I was sure of it she said but when I couldnt see her anywhere I went to look in the hot tub She lit a cigarette What I saw made me feel like screaming Andy  Karen was underwater All that was out was her hand    the nails were turning purple After that    I guess I dived in but I dont remember I was zoned out Everything from then on is like a dream where stuff runs together in your mind The yardguy  Sanborn  shoved me aside and dived His foot hit me in the throat and I couldnt swallow for a week He yanked up on Karens arm I thought hed pull it off her damn shoulder but he got her He got her In the gloom Drake saw she was weeping God Oh God I thought she was dead I was sure she was I knew at once but laid my steno pad along the left margin of the manuscript so I could see it better Reading down as youd read a vertical crosswordpuzzle answer the first letter of each line spelled the message which had been there almost since I began the book owls undEr stud O Then allowing for the indent nexttolast line from the bottom owls undEr studIO Bill Dean my caretaker is sitting behind the wheel of his truck He has accomplished his two purposes in coming here  welcoming me back to the TR and warning me off Mattie Devore Now hes ready to go He smiles at me displaying those big false teeth those Roebuckers If you get a chance you ought to look for the owls he tells me I ask him what Jo would have wanted with a couple of plastic owls and he replies that they keep the crows from shitting up the woodwork I accept that I have other things to think about but still    It was like shed come down to do that errand special he says It never crosses my mind  not then at least  that in Indian folklore owls have another purpose they are said to keep evil spirits away If Jo knew that plastic owls would scare the crows off she would have known that It was just the sort of information she picked up and tucked away My inquisitive wife My brilliant scatterbrain Thunder rolled Lightning ate at the clouds like spills of bright acid I stood by the diningroom table with the manuscript in my unsteady hands Christ Jo I whispered What did you find out And why didnt you tell me But I thought I knew the answer to that She hadnt told me because I was somehow like Max Devore his greatgrandfather and my own had shit in the same pit It didnt make any sense but there it was And she hadnt told her own brother either I took a weird kind of comfort from that I began to leaf through the manuscript my skin crawling Andy Drake rarely frowned in Michael Noonans My Childhood Friend He scowled instead because theres an owl in every scowl Before coming to Florida John Shackleford had been living in Studio City California Drakes first meeting with Regina Whiting occurred in her studio Ray Garratys lastknown address was the Studio Apartments in Key Largo Regina Whitings best friend was Steffie Underwood Steffis husband was Towle Underwood  there was a good one two for the price of one Owls under studio It was everywhere on every page just like the Knames in the telephone book A kind of monument this one built  I was sure of it  not by Sara Tidwell but by Johanna Arlen Noonan My wife passing messages behind the guards back praying with all her considerable heart that I would see and understand On page ninetytwo Shackleford was talking to Drake in the prison visitors room  sitting with his wrists between his knees looking down at the chain running between his ankles refusing to make eyecontact with Drake FRIEND by NoonanPg  only thing I got to say Anything else fuck what good would it do Lifes a game and I lost You want me to tell you that I yanked some little kid out of the water pulled her up got her motor going again I did but not because Im a hero or a saint     There was more but no need to read it The message owls under studio ran down the margin just as it had on page nineteen As it probably did on any number of other pages as well I remembered how deliriously happy I had been to discover that the block had been dissolved and I could write again It had been dissolved all right but not because Id finally beaten it or found a way around it Jo had dissolved it Jo had beaten it and my continued career as a writer of secondrate thrillers had been the least of her concerns when she did it As I stood there in the flickerflash of lightning feeling my unseen guests swirl around me in the unsteady air I remembered Mrs Moran my firstgrade teacher When your efforts to replicate the smooth curves of the Palmer Method alphabet on the blackboard began to flag and waver she would put her large competent hand over yours and help you So had Jo helped me I riffled through the manuscript and saw the key words everywhere sometimes placed so you could actually read them stacked on different lines one above the other How hard she had tried to tell me this    and I had no intention of doing anything else until I found out why I dropped the manuscript back on the table but before I could reanchor it a furious gust of freezing air blew past me lifting the pages and scattering them everywhere in a cyclone If that force could have ripped them to shreds Im sure that it would have No it cried as I grabbed the lanterns handle No finish the job Wind blew around my face in chill gusts  it was as if someone I couldnt quite see was standing right in front of me and breathing in my face retreating as I moved forward huffing and puffing like the big bad wolf outside the houses of the three little pigs I hung the lantern over my arm held my hands out in front of me and clapped them together sharply The cold puffs in my face ceased There was now only the random swirling air coming in through the partially plugged kitchen window Shes sleeping I said to what I knew was still there silently watching Theres time I went out the back door and the wind took me at once making me stagger sideways almost knocking me over And in the wavering trees I saw green faces the faces of the dead Devores was there and Royces and Son Tidwells Most of all I saw Saras Everywhere Sara No Go back You dont need no truck with no owls sugar Go back Finish the job Do what you came for I dont know what I came for I said And until I find out Im not doing anything The wind screamed as if in offense and a huge branch split off the pine standing to the right of the house It fell on top of my Chevrolet in a spray of water denting the roof before rolling off on my side Clapping my hands out here would be every bit as useful as King Canute commanding the tide to turn This was her world not mine    and only the edge of it at that Every step closer to The Street and the lake would bring me closer to that worlds heart where time was thin and spirits ruled Oh dear God what had happened to cause this The path to Jos studio had turned into a creek I got a dozen steps down it before a rock turned under my foot and I fell heavily on my side Lightning zigged across the sky there was the crack of another breaking branch and then something was falling toward me I put my hands up to shield my face and rolled to the right off the path The branch splashed to the ground just behind me and I tumbled halfway down a slope that was slick with soaked needles At last I was able to pull myself to my feet The branch on the path was even bigger than the one which had landed on the roof of the car If it had struck me it likely would have bashed in my skull Go back A hissing spiteful wind through the trees Finish it The slobbering guttural voice of the lake slamming into the rocks and the bank below The Street Mind your business That was the very house itself groaning on its foundations Mind your business and let me mind mine But Kyra was my business Kyra was my daughter I picked up the lantern The housing was cracked but the bulb glowed bright and steady  that was one for the home team Bent over against the howling wind hand raised to ward off more falling branches I slipped and stumbled my way down the hill to my dead wifes studio At first the door wouldnt open The knob turned under my hand so I knew it wasnt locked but the rain seemed to have swelled the wood   or had something been shoved up against it I drew back crouched a little and hit the door with my shoulder This time there was some slight give It was her Sara Standing on the other side of the door and trying to hold it shut against me How could she do that How in Gods name She was a fucking ghost I thought of the BAMM CONSTRUCTION pickup    and as if thought were conjuration I could almost see it out there at the end of Lane Fortytwo parked by the highway The old ladies sedan was behind it and three or four other cars were now behind them All of them with their windshield wipers flopping back and forth their headlights cutting feeble cones through the downpour They were lined up on the shoulder like cars at a yard sale There was no yard sale here only the oldtimers sitting silently in their cars Oldtimers who were in the zone just like I was Oldtimers sending in the vibe She was drawing on them Stealing from them Shed done the same with Devore  and me too of course Many of the manifestations Id experienced since coming back had likely been created from my own psychic energy It was amusing when you thought of it Or maybe terrifying was the word I was actually looking for Jo help me I said in the pouring rain Lightning flashed turning the torrents a bright brief silver If you ever loved me help me now I drew back and hit the door again This time there was no resistance at all and I went hurtling in catching my shin on the jamb and falling to my knees I held onto the lantern though There was a moment of silence In it I felt forces and presences gathering themselves In that moment nothing seemed to move although behind me in the woods Jo had loved to ramble  with me or without me  the rain continued to fall and the wind continued to howl a merciless gardener pruning its way through the trees that were dead and almost dead doing the work of ten gentler years in one turbulent hour Then the door slammed shut and it began I saw everything in the glow of the flashlight which I had turned on without even realizing it but at first I didnt know exactly what I was seeing other than the destruction by poltergeist of my wifes beloved crafts and treasures The framed afghan square tore itself off the wall and flew from one side of the studio to the other the black oak frame breaking apart The heads popped off the dolls poking out of the baby collages like champagne corks at a party The hanging lightglobe shattered showering me with fragments of glass A wind began to blow  a cold one  and was quickly joined and whirled into a cyclone by one which was warmer almost hot They rolled past me as if in imitation of the larger storm outside The Sara Laughs head on the bookcase the one which appeared to be constructed of toothpicks and lollipop sticks exploded in a cloud of woodsplinters The kayak paddle leaning against the wall rose into the air rowed furiously at nothing then launched itself at me like a spear I threw myself flat on the green rag rug to avoid it and felt bits of broken glass from the shattered lightglobe cut into the palm of my hand as I came down I felt something else as well  a ridge of something beneath the rug The paddle hit the far wall hard enough to split into two pieces Now the banjo my wife had never been able to master rose in the air revolved twice and played a bright rattle of notes that were out of tune but nonetheless unmistakable  wish I was in the land of cotton old times there are not forgotten The phrase ended with a vicious BLUNK that broke all five strings The banjo whirled itself a third time its bright steel fittings reflecting fishscale runs of light on the study walls and then beat itself to death against the floor the drum shattering and the tuning pegs snapping off like teeth The sound of moving air began to  how do I express this  to focus somehow until it wasnt the sound of air but the sound of voices  panting unearthly voices full of fury They would have screamed if theyd had vocal cords to scream with Dusty air swirled up in the beam of my flashlight making helix shapes that danced together then reeled apart again For just a moment I heard Saras snarling smokebroken voice Git out bitch You git on out This aint none of yours   And then a curious insubstantial thud as if air had collided with air This was followed by a rushing windtunnel shriek that I recognized Id heard it in the middle of the night Jo was screaming Sara was hurting her Sara was punishing her for presuming to interfere and Jo was screaming No I shouted getting to my feet Leave her alone Leave her be I advanced into the room swinging the lantern in front of my face as if I could beat her away with it Stoppered bottles stormed past me  some contained dried flowers some carefully sectioned mushrooms some woodsherbs They shattered against the far wall with a brittle xylophone sound None of them struck me it was as if an unseen hand guided them away Then Jos rolltop desk rose into the air It must have weighed at least four hundred pounds with its drawers loaded as they were but it floated like a feather nodding first one way and then dipping the other in the opposing currents of air Jo screamed again this time in anger rather than pain and I staggered backward against the closed door with a feeling that I had been scooped hollow Sara wasnt the only one who could steal the energy of the living it appeared White semeny stuff  ectoplasm I guess  spilled from the desks pigeonholes in a dozen little streams and the desk suddenly launched itself across the room It flew almost too fast to follow with the eye Anyone standing in front of it would have been smashed flat There was a headsplitting shriek of protest and agony  Sara this time I knew it was  and then the desk struck the wall breaking through it and letting in the rain and the wind The rolltop snapped loose of its slot and hung like a jointed tongue All the drawers shot out Spools of thread skeins of yarn little florafauna identification books and woods guides thimbles notebooks knitting needles driedup Magic Markers  Jos early remains Ki might have called them They flew everywhere like bones and bits of hair cruelly scattered from a disinterred coffin Stop it I croaked Stop it both of you Thats enough But there was no need to tell them Except for the furious beat of the storm I was alone in the ruins of my wifes studio The battle was over At least for the time being I knelt and doubled up the green rag rug carefully folding into it as much of the shattered glass from the light as I could Beneath it was a trapdoor giving on a triangular storage area created by the slope of the land as it dropped toward the lake The ridge Id felt was one of the traps hinges I had known about this area and had meant to check it for the owls Then things began to happen and Id forgotten There was a recessed ring in the trapdoor I grabbed it ready for more resistance but it swung up easily The smell that wafted up froze me in my tracks Not damp decay at least not at first but Red  Jos favorite perfume It hung around me for a moment and then it was gone What replaced it was the smell of rain roots and wet earth Not pleasant but I had smelled far worse down by the lake near that damned birch tree I shone my light down three steep steps I could see a squat shape that turned out to be an old toilet  I could vaguely remember Bill and Kenny Auster putting it under here back in  or  There were steel boxes  filing cabinet drawers actually  wrapped in plastic and stacked up on pallets Old records and papers An eighttrack tape player wrapped in a plastic bag An old VCR next to it in another one And over in the corner  I sat down hung my legs over and felt something touch the ankle I had turned in the lake I shone my light between my knees and for one moment saw a young black kid Not the one drowned in the lake though  this one was older and quite a lot bigger Twelve maybe fourteen The drowned boy had been no more than eight This one bared his teeth at me and hissed like a cat There were no pupils in his eyes like those of the boy in the lake his eyes were entirely white like the eyes of a statue And he was shaking his head Dont come down here white man Let the dead rest in peace But youre not at peace I said and shone the light full on him I had a momentary glimpse of a truly hideous thing I could see through him but I could also see into him the rotting remains of his tongue in his mouth his eyes in their sockets his brain simmering like a spoiled egg in its case of skull Then he was gone and there was nothing but one of those swirling dusthelixes I went down holding the lantern raised Below it nests of shadows rocked and seemed to reach upward The storage area it was really no more than a glorified crawlspace had been floored with wooden pallets just to keep stuff off the ground Now water ran beneath these in a steady river and enough of the earth had eroded to make even crawling unsteady work The smell of perfume was entirely gone What had replaced it was a nasty riverbottom smell and  unlikely given the conditions I know but it was there  the faint sullen smell of ash and fire I saw what Id come for almost at once Jos mailorder owls the ones she had taken delivery of herself in November of  were in the northeast corner where there were only about two feet between the sloped pallet flooring and the underside of the studio Gorry but they looked real Bill had said and Gorry if he wasnt right in the bright glow of the lantern they looked like birds first swaddled then suffocated in clear plastic Their eyes were bright wedding rings circling wide black pupils Their plastic feathers were painted the dark green of pine needies their bellies a shade of dirty orangewhite I crawled toward them over the squelching shifting pallets the glow of the lantern bobbing back and forth between them trying not to wonder if that boy was behind me creeping in pursuit When I got to the owls I raised my head without thinking and thudded it against the insulation which ran beneath the studio floor Thump once for yes twice for no asshole I thought I hooked my fingers into the plastic which wrapped the owls and pulled them toward me I wanted to be out of here The sensation of water running just beneath me was strange and unpleasant So was the smell of fire which seemed stronger now in spite of the damp Suppose the studio was burning Suppose Sara had somehow set it alight Id roast down here even while the storms muddy runoff was soaking my legs and belly One of the owls stood on a plastic base I saw  the better to set him on your deck or stoop to scare the crows my dear  but the base the other should have been attached to was missing I backed toward the trapdoor holding the lantern in one hand and dragging the plastic sack of owls in the other wincing each time thunder cannonaded over my head Id only gotten a little way when the damp tape holding the plastic gave way The owl missing its base tilted slowly toward me its blackgold eyes staring raptly into my own A swirl of air A faint comforting whiff of Red perfume I pulled the owl out by the hornlike tufts growing from its forehead and turned it upside down Where it had once been attached to its plastic base there were now only two pegs with a hollow space between them Inside the hole was a small tin box that I recognized even before I reached into the owls belly and chivvied it out I shone the lantern on its front knowing what Id see JOS NOTIONS written in oldfashioned gilt script She had found the box in an antiques barn somewhere I looked at it my heart beating hard Thunder boomed overhead The trapdoor stood open but I had forgotten about going up I had forgotten about everything but the tin box I held in my hand a box roughly the size of a cigar box but not quite as deep I spread my hand over the cover and pulled it off There was a strew of folded papers lying on top of a pair of steno books the wirebound ones I keep around for notes and character lists These had been rubberbanded together On top of everything else was a shiny black square Until I picked it up and held it close to the side of the lantern I didnt realize it was a photo negative Ghostly reversed and faintly orange I saw Jo in her gray twopiece bathing suit She was standing on the swimming float with her hands behind her head Jo I said and then couldnt say anything else My throat had closed up with tears I held the negative for a moment not wanting to lose contact with it then put it back in the box with the papers and steno books This stuff was why she had come to Sara in July of  to gather it up and hide it as well as she could She had taken the owls off the deck Frank had heard the door out there bang and had carried them out here I could almost see her prying the base off one owl and stuffing the tin box up its plastic wazoo wrapping both of them in plastic then dragging them down here all while her brother sat smoking Marlboros and feeling the vibrations The bad vibrations I doubted if I would ever know all the reasons why shed done it or what her frame of mind had been    but she had almost certainly believed Id find my own way down here eventually Why else had she left the negative The loose papers were mostly photocopied press clippings from the Castle Rock Call and from the Weekly News the paper which had apparently preceded the Call The dates were marked on each in my wifes neat firm hand The oldest clipping was from  and was headed ANOTHER HOME SAFE The returnee was one Jared Devore age thirtytwo Suddenly I understood one of the things that had puzzled me the generations which didnt seem to match up A Sara Tidwell song came to mind as I crouched there on the pallets with my lantern shining down on that oldtimey type It was the ditty that went The old folks do it and the young folks too  And the old folks show the young folks just what to do    By the time Sara and the RedTops showed up in Castle County and settled on what became known as Tidwells Meadow Jared Devore would have been sixtyseven or eight Old but still hale A veteran of the Civil War The sort of older man younger men might look up to And Saras song was right  the old folks show the young folks just what to do What exactly had they done The clippings about Sara and the RedTops didnt tell I only skimmed them anyway but the overall tone shook me just the same Id describe it as unfailing genial contempt The RedTops were our Southern blackbirds and our rhythmic darkies They were full of dusky goodnature Sara herself was a marvelous figure of a Negro woman with broad nose full lips and noble brow who fascinated menfolk and womenfolk alike with her animal high spirits flashing smile and raucous laugh They were God keep us and save us reviews Good ones if you didnt mind being called full of dusky goodnature I shuffled through them quickly looking for anything about the circumstances under which our Southern blackbirds had left I found nothing What I found instead was a clipping from the Call marked July th go down nineteen I thought  The headline read VETERAN GUIDE CARETAKER CANNOT SAVE DAUGHTER According to the story Fred Dean had been fighting the wildfires in the eastern part of the TR with two hundred other men when the wind had suddenly changed menacing the north end of the lake which had previously been considered safe At that time a great many local people had kept fishing and hunting camps up there this much I knew myself The community had had a general store and an actual name Halo Bay Freds wife Hilda was there with the Dean twins William and Carla age three while her husband was off eating smoke A good many other wives and kids were in Halo Bay as well The fires had come fast when the wind changed the paper said like marching explosions They jumped the only firebreak the men had left in that direction and headed for the far end of the lake At Halo Bay there were no men to take charge and apparently no women able or willing to do so They panicked instead racing to load their cars with children and camp possessions clogging the one road out with their vehicles Eventually one of the old cars or trucks broke down and as the fires roared closer running through woods that hadnt seen rain since late April the women whod waited found their way out blocked The volunteer firefighters came to the rescue in time but when Fred Dean got to his wife one of a party of women trying to push a balky stalled Ford coupe out of the road he made a terrible discovery Billy lay on the floor in the back of the car fast asleep but Carla was missing Hilda had gotten them both in all right  they had been on the back seat holding hands just as they always did But at some point after her brother had crawled onto the floor and dozed off and while Hilda was stuffing a few last items into the trunk Carla must have remembered a toy or a doll and returned to the cottage to get it While she was doing that her mother had gotten into their old Desoto and driven away without rechecking the babies Carla Dean was either still in the cottage at Halo Bay or making her way up the road on foot Either way the fires would run her down The road was too narrow to get a vehicle turned around and too blocked to get one of those pointed in the right direction through the crush So Fred Dean hero that he was set off on the run toward the smokeblackened horizon where bright ribbons of orange had already begun to shine through The winddriven fire had crowned and raced to meet him like a lover I knelt on the pallets reading this by the glow of my lantern and all at once the smell of fire and burning intensified I coughed    and then the cough was choked off by the iron taste of water in my mouth and throat Once again this time kneeling in the storage area beneath my wifes studio I felt as if I were drowning Once again I leaned forward and retched up nothing but a little spit I turned and saw the lake The loons were screaming on its hazy surface making their way toward me in a line beating their wings against the water as they came The blue of the sky had been blotted out The air smelled of charcoal and gunpowder Ash had begun to sift down from the sky The eastern verge of Dark Score was in flames and I could hear occasional muffled reports as hollow trees exploded They sounded like depth charges I looked down wanting to break free of this vision knowing that in another moment or two it wouldnt be anything so distant as a vision but as real as the trip Kyra and I had made to the Fryeburg Fair Instead of a plastic owl with goldringed eyes I was looking at a child with bright blue ones She was sitting on a picnic table holding out her chubby arms and crying I saw her as clearly as I saw my own face in the mirror each morning when I shaved I saw she was about Kyras age but much plumper and her hair is black instead of blonde Her hair is the shade her brothers will remain until it finally begins to go gray in the impossibly distant summer of  a year she will never see unless someone gets her out of this hell She wears a white dress and red kneestockings and she holds her arms out to me calling Daddy Daddy I start toward her and then there is a blast of organized heat that tears me apart for a moment  I am the ghost here I realize and Fred Dean has just run right through me Daddy she cries but to him not me Daddy and she hugs him unmindful of the soot smearing her white silk dress and her chubby face as he kisses her and more soot begins to fall and the loons beat their way in toward shore seeming to weep in shrill lamentation Daddy the fire is coming she cries as he scoops her into his arms I know be brave he says Were gonna be all right sugarplum but you have to be brave The fire isnt just coming it has come The entire east end of Halo Bay is inflames and now theyre moving this way eating one by one the little cabins where the men like to lay up drunk in hunting season and icefishing season Behind Al LeRouxs the washing Marguerite hung out that morning is in flames pants and dresses and underwear burning on lines which are themselves strings of fire Leaves and bark shower down a burning ember touches Carlas neck and she shrieks with pain Fred slaps it away as he carries her down the slope of land to the water Dont do it I scream I know all this is beyond my power to change but I scream at him anyway try to change it anyway Fight it For Christs sake fight it Daddy who is that man Carla asks and points at me as the greenshingled roof of the Dean place catches fire Fred glances toward where she is pointing and in his face I see a spasm of guilt He knows what hes doing thats the terrible thing  way down deep he knows exactly what he is doing here at Halo Bay where The Street ends He knows and hes afraid that someone will witness his work But he sees nothing Or does he There is a momentary doubtful widening of the eyes as if he does spy something  a dancing helix of air perhaps Or does feel me Is that it Does he feel a momentary cold draft in all this heat One that feels like protesting hands hands that would restrain if they only had substance Then he looks away then he is wading into the water beside the Deans stub of a dock Fred I scream For Gods sake man look at her Do you think your wife put her in a white silk dress by accident Is that anyones idea of a playdress Daddy why are we going in the water she asks To get away from the fire sugarplum Daddy I cant swim You wont have to he replies and what a chill I feel at that Because its no lie  she wont have to swim not now not ever And at least Freds way will be more merciful than Normal Austers when Normals turn comes  more merciful than the squalling handpump the gallons of freezing water Her white dress floats around her like a lily Her red stockings shimmer in the water She hugs his neck tightly and now they are among the fleeing loons the loons spank the water with their powerful wings churning up curds of jam and staring at the man and the girl with their distraught red eyes The air is heavy with smoke and the sky is gone I stagger after them wading  I can feel the cold of the water although I dont splash and leave no wake The eastern and northern edges of the lake are both on fire now there is a burning crescent around us as Fred Dean wades deeper with his daughter carrying her as if to some baptismal rite And still he tells himself he is trying to save her only to save her just as all her life Hilda will tell herself that the child just wandered back to the cottage to look for a toy that she was not left behind on purpose left in her white dress and red stockings to be found by her father who once did something unspeakable This is the past this is the Land of Ago and here the sins of the fathers are visited on the children even unto the seventh generation which is not yet He takes her deeper and she begins to scream Her screams mingle with the screams of the loons until he stops the sound with a kiss upon her terrified mouth Love you Daddy loves his sugarplum he says and then lowers her It is to be a fullimmersion baptism then except there is no shorebank choir singing Shall We Gather at the River and no one shouting Hallelujah and he is not letting her come back up She struggles furiously in the white bloom of her sacrificial dress and after a moment he cannot bear to watch her he looks across the lake instead to the west where the fire hasnt yet touched and never will to the west where skies are still blue Ash sifts around him like black rain and the tears pour out of his eyes and as she struggles furiously beneath his hands trying to free herself from his drowning grip he tells himself It was an accident just a terrible accident I took her out in the lake because it was the only place I could take her the only place left and she panicked she started to struggle she was all wet and all slippery and I lost my good hold on her and then I lost any hold on her and then  I forget Im a ghost I scream Kia Hold on Ki and dive I reach her I see her terrified face her bulging blue eyes her rosebud of a mouth which is trailing a silver line of bubbles toward the surface where Fred stands in water up to his neck holding her down while he tells himself over and over that he was trying to save her it was the only way he was trying to save her it was the only way I reach for her again and again I reach for her my child my daughter my Kia they are all Kia the boys as well as the girls all my daughter and each time my arms go through her Worse  oh far worse  is that now she is reaching for me her dappled arms floating out begging for rescue Her groping hands melt through mine I cannot touch because now I am the ghost I am the ghost and as her struggles weaken I realize that I cant I cant oh I couldnt breathe  I was drowning I doubled over opened my mouth and this time a great spew of lakewater came out soaking the plastic owl which lay on the pallet by my knees I hugged the JOS NOTIONS box to my chest not wanting the contents to get wet and the movement triggered another retch This time cold water poured from my nose as well as my mouth I dragged in a deep breath then coughed it out This has got to end I said but of course this was the end one way or the other Because Kyra was last I climbed up the steps to the studio and sat on the littered floor to get my breath Outside the thunder boomed and the rain fell but I thought the storm had passed its peak of fury Or maybe I only hoped I rested with my legs hanging down through the trap  there were no more ghosts here to touch my ankles I dont know how I knew that but I did  and stripped off the rubber bands holding the steno notebooks together I opened the first one paged through it and saw it was almost filled with Jos handwriting and a number of folded typed sheets Courier type of course singlespaced the fruit of all those clandestine trips down to the TR during  and  Fragmentary notes for the most part and transcriptions of tapes which might still be down below me in the storage space somewhere Tucked away with the VCR or the eighttrack player perhaps But I didnt need them When the time came  if the time came  I was sure Id find most of the story here What had happened who had done it how it was covered up Right now I didnt care Right now I only wanted to make sure that Kyra was safe and stayed safe There was only one way to do that Lye stille I attempted to slip the rubber bands around the steno books again and the one I hadnt looked at slipped out of my wet hand and fell to the floor A torn slip of green paper fell out I picked it up and saw this For a moment I came out of that strange and heightened awareness Id been living in the world fell back into its accustomed dimensions But the colors were all too strong somehow objects too emphatically present I felt like a battlefield soldier suddenly illuminated by a ghastly white flare one that shows everything My fathers people had come from The Neck I had been right about that much my greatgrandfather according to this was James Noonan and he had never shit in the same pit as Jared Devore Max Devore had either been lying when he said that to Mattie    or misinformed    or simply confused the way folks often get confused when they reach their eighties Even a fellow like Devore who had stayed mostly sharp wouldnt have been exempt from the occasional nick in his edge And he hadnt been that far off at that Because according to this little scratch of a chart my greatgrandfather had had an older sister Bridget And Bridget had married  Benton Auster My finger dropped down a line to Harry Auster Born of Benton and Bridget Noonan Auster in the year  Christ Jesus I whispered Kenny Austers grandfather was my granduncle And he was one of them Whatever they did Harry Auster was one of them Thats the connection I thought of Kyra with sudden sharp terror She had been up at the house by herself for nearly an hour How could I have been so stupid Anyone could have come in while I was under the studio Sara could have used anyone to  I realized that wasnt true The murderers and the child victims had all been linked by blood and now that blood had thinned that river had almost reached the sea There was Bill Dean but he was staying well away from Sara Laughs There was Kenny Auster but Kenny had taken himself and his family off to Taxachusetts And Kis closest blood relations  mother father grandfather  were all dead Only I was left Only I was blood Only I could do it Unless  I bolted back up to the house as fast as I could slipping and sliding my way along the soaked path desperate to make sure she was all right I didnt think Sara could hurt Kyra herself no matter how much of that oldtimer vibe she had to draw on    but what if I was wrong What if I was wrong Ki lay fast asleep just as I had left her on her side with the filthy little stuffed dog clutched under her jaw It had put a smudge on her neck but I hadnt the heart to take it away from her Beyond her and to the left through the open bathroom door I could hear the steady plinkplonkplink of water falling from the faucet and into the tub Cool air blew around me in a silky twist caressing my cheeks sending a not unpleasurable shiver up my back In the living room Bunters bell gave a dim little shake Waters still warm sugar Sara whispered Be her friend be her daddy Go on now Do what I want Do what we both want And I did want to which had to be why Jo at first tried to keep me away from the TR and from Sara Laughs Why shed made a secret of her possible pregnancy as well It was as if I had discovered a vampire inside me a creature with no interest in what it thought of as talkshow conscience and oped page morality A part that wanted only to take Ki into the bathroom and dunk her into that tub of warm water and hold her under watching the rededged white ribbons shimmer the way Carla Deans white dress and red stockings had shimmered while the woods burned all around her and her father A part of me would be more than glad to pay the last installment on that old bill Dear God I muttered and wiped my face with a shaking hand She knows so many tricks And shes so fucking strong The bathroom door tried to swing shut against me before I could go through but I pushed it open against hardly any resistance The medicinecabinet door banged back and the glass shattered against the wall The stuff inside flew out at me but it wasnt a very dangerous attack this time most of the missiles consisted of toothpaste tubes toothbrushes plastic bottles and a few old Vicks inhalers Faint very faint I could hear her shouting in frustration as I yanked the plug at the bottom of the tub and let the water start gurgling out There had been enough drowning on the TR for one century by God And yet for a moment I felt an incredibly strong urge to put the plug back in while the water was still deep enough to do the job Instead I tore it off its chain and threw it down the hall The medicinecabinet door clapped shut again and the rest of the glass fell out How many have you had I asked her How many besides Carla Dean and Kerry Auster and our Kia Two Three Five How many do you need before you can rest All of them the answer shot back It wasnt just Saras voice either it was my own as well Shed gotten into me had snuck in by way of the basement like a burglar   and already I was thinking that even if the tub was empty and the waterpump temporarily dead there was always the lake All of them the voice cried again All of them sugar Of course  only all of them would do Until then there would be no rest for Sara Laughs Ill help you to rest I said That I promise The last of the water swirled away    but there was always the lake always the lake if I changed my mind I left the bathroom and looked in on Ki again She hadnt moved the sensation that Sara was in here with me had gone Bunters bell was quiet    and yet I felt uneasy unwilling to leave her alone I had to though if I was to finish my work and I would do well not to linger County and State cops would be along eventually storm or no storm downed trees or no downed trees Yes but    I stepped into the hall and looked uneasily around Thunder boomed but it was losing some of its urgency So was the wind What wasnt fading was the sense of something watching me something that was notSara I stood where I was a moment or two longer trying to tell myself it was just the sizzle of my overcooked nerves then walked down the hall to the entry I opened the door to the stoop    then looked around again sharply as if expecting to see someone or something lurking behind the far end of the bookcase A Shape perhaps Something that still wanted its dustcatcher But I was the only Shape left at least in this part of the world and the only movement I saw was rippleshadows thrown by the rain rolling down the windows It was still coming down hard enough to redrench me as I crossed my stoop to the driveway but I paid no attention I had just been with a little girl when she drowned had damned near drowned myself not so long ago and the rain wasnt going to stop me from doing what I had to do I picked up the fallen branch which had dented the roof of my car tossed it aside and opened the Chevys rear door The things Id bought at Slips n Greens were still sitting on the back seat still tucked into the cloth carryhandle bag Lila Proulx had given me The trowel and the pruning knife were visible but the third item was in a plastic sack Want this one in a special bag Lila had asked me Always sab never sorry And later as I was leaving she had spoken of Kennys dog Blueberry chasing seagulls and had given out with a big hearty laugh Her eyes hadnt laughed though Maybe thats how you tell the Martians from the Earthlings  the Martians can never laugh with their eyes I saw Rommie and Georges present lying on the front seat the Stenomask Id at first mistaken for Devores oxygen mask The boys in the basement spoke up then  murmured at least  and I leaned over the seat to grab the mask by its elastic strap without the slightest idea of why I was doing so I dropped it into the carrybag slammed the car door then started down the railroadtie steps to the lake On the way I paused to duck under the deck where we had always kept a few tools There was no pick but I grabbed a spade that looked up to a piece of gravedigging Then for what I thought would be the last time I followed the course of my dream down to The Street I didnt need Jo to show me the spot the Green Lady had been pointing to it all along Even had she not been and even if Sara Tidwell did not still stink to the heavens I think I would have known I think I would have been led there by my own haunted heart There was a man standing between me and the place where the gray forehead of rock guarded the path and as I paused on the last railroad tie he hailed me in a rasping voice that I knew all too well Say there whoremaster wheres your whore He stood on The Street in the pouring rain but his cutters outfit  green flannel pants checked wool shirt  and his faded blue Union Army cap were dry because the rain was falling through him rather than on him He looked solid but he was no more real than Sara herself I reminded myself of this as I stepped down onto the path to face him but my heart continued to speed up thudding in my chest like a padded hammer He was dressed in Jared Devores clothes but this wasnt Jared Devore This was Jareds greatgrandson Max who had begun his career with an act of sledtheft and ended it in suicide    but not before arranging for the murder of his daughterinlaw whod had the temerity to refuse him what he had so dearly wanted I started toward him and he moved to the center of the path to block me I could feel the cold baking off him I am saying exactly what I mean expressing what I remember as clearly as I can I could feel the cold baking off him And yes it was Max Devore all right but got up like a logger at a costume party and looking the way he must have around the time his son Lance was born Old but hale The sort of man younger men might well look up to And now as if the thought had called them I could see the rest shimmer into faint being behind him standing in a line across the path These were the ones who had been with Jared at the Fryeburg Fair and now I knew who some of them were Fred Dean of course only nineteen years old in  the drowning of his daughter still over thirty years away And the one who had reminded me of myself was Harry Auster the firstborn of my greatgrandfathers sister He would have been sixteen barely old enough to raise a fuzz but old enough to work in the woods with Jared Old enough to shit in the same pit as Jared To mistake Jareds poison for wisdom One of the others twisted his head and squinted at the same time  Id seen that tic before Where Then it came to me in the Lakeview General This young man was the late Royce Merrills father The others I didnt know Nor did I care to You aint apassing by us Devore said He held up both hands Dont even think about trying Am I right boys They murmured growling agreement  the sort you could hear coming from any presentday gang of headbangers or taggers I imagine  but their voices were distant actually more sad than menacing There was some substance to the man in Jared Devores clothes perhaps because in life he had been a man of enormous vitality perhaps because he was so recently dead but the others were little more than projected images I started forward moving into that baking cold moving into the smell of him  the same invalid odors which had surrounded him when Id met him here before Where do you think youre going he cried For a constitutional I said And no law against it The Streets the place where good pups and vile dogs can walk sidebyside You said so yourself You dont understand MaxJared said You never will Youre not of that world That was our world I stopped looking at him curiously Time was short I wanted to be done with this    but I had to know and I thought Devore was ready to tell me Make me understand I said Convince me that any world was your world I looked at him then at the flickering translucent figures behind him gauze flesh heaped on shining bones Tell me what you did It was all different then Devore said When you come down here Noonan you might walk all three miles north to Halo Bay and see only a dozen people on The Street After Labor Day you might not see any one at all This side of the lake you have to walk through the bushes that are growing up wild and around the fallen trees  therell be even more of em after this storm  and even a deadfall or two because nowadays the townfolk dont club together to keep it neat the way they used to But in our time   The woods were bigger then Noonan distances were farther to go and neighboring meant something Life itself often enough Back then this really was a street Can you see I could If I looked through the phantom shapes of Fred Dean and Harry Auster and the others I could They werent just ghosts they were shimmerglass windows on another age I saw a summer afternoon in the year of     Perhaps   Doesnt matter This is a period when all time seems the same as if time had stopped This is a time the oldtimers remember as a kind of golden age It is the Land of Ago the Kingdom of WhenIWasaBoy The sun washes everything with the fine gold light of endless late July the lake is as blue as a dream netted with a billion sparks of reflected light And The Street It is as smoothly grassed as a lawn and as broad as a boulevard It is a boulevard I see a place where the community fully realizes itself It is the main conduit of communication the chief cable in a township crisscrossed with them Id felt the existence of these cables all along  even when Jo was alive I felt them under the surface and here is their point of origin Folks promenade on The Street all up and down the east side of Dark Score Lake they promenade in little groups laughing and conversing under a cloudstacked summer sky and this is where the cables all begin I look and realize how wrong I have been to think of them as Martians as cruel and calculating aliens East of their sunny promenade looms the darkness of the woods glades and hollows where any miserable thing may await from a hot lopped off in a logging accident to a birth gone wrong and a young mother dead before the doctor can arrive from Castle Rock in his buggy These are people with no electricity no phones no County Rescue Unit no one to rely upon but each other and a God some of them have already begun to mistrust They live in the woods and the shadows of the woods but on fine summer afternoons they come to the edge of the lake They come to The Street and look in each others faces and laugh together and then they are truly on the TR  in what I have come to think of as the zone They are not Martians they are little lives dwelling on the edge of the dark thats all I see summer people from Warringtons the men dressed in white flannels two women in long tennis dresses still carrying their rackets A fellow riding a tricycle with an enormous front wheel weaves shakily among them The party of summer fok has stopped to talk with a group of young men from town the fellows from away want to know if they can play in the townies baseball game at Warringtons on Tuesday night Ben Merrill Royces fathertobe says Ayuh but we wont go easy on ya just cause youre from NYawk The young men laugh so do the tennis girls A little farther on two boys are playing catch with the sort of raw homemade baseball that is known as a horsey Beyond them is a convention of young mothers talking earnestly of their babies all safely prammed and gathered in their own group Men in overalls discuss weather and crops politics and crops taxes and crops A teacher from the Consolidated High sits on the gray stone forehead I know so well patiently tutoring a sullen boy who wants to be somewhere else and doing anything else I think the boy will grow up to be Buddy Jellisons father Horn broken  watch for finger I think All along The Street folks are fishing and they are catching plenty the lake fairly teems with bass and trout and pickerel An artist  another summer fellow judging from his smock and nancy beret  has set up his easel and is painting the mountains while two ladies watch respectfully A giggle of girls passes whispering about boys and clothes and school There is beauty here and peace Devore s right to say this is a world I never knew Its Beautiful I said pulling myself back with an effort Yes I see that But whats your point My point Devore looked almost comically surprised She thought she could walk there like everyone else thats the fucking point She thought she could walk there like a white gal Her and her big teeth and her big tits and her snotty looks She thought she was something special but we taught her different She tried to walk me down and when she couldnt do that she put her filthy hands on me and tumped me over But that was all right we taught her her manners Didnt we boys They growled agreement but I thought some of them  young Harry Auster for one  looked sick We taught her her place Devore said We taught her she wasnt nothing but a nigger This is the word he uses over and over again when they are in the woods that summer the summer of the summer that Sara and the Redbps become the musical act to see in this part of the world She and her brother and their whole nigger family have been invited to Warringtons to play for the summer people they have been rid on champagne and ersters    or so says Jared Devore to his little school of devoted followers as they eat their own plain lunches of bread and meat and salted cucumbers out of lardbuckets given to them by their mothers none of the young men are married although Oren Peebles is engaged Yet it isnt her growing renown that upsets Jared Devore It isnt the fact that she has been to Warringtons it dont cross his eyes none that she and that brother of hers have actually sat down and eaten with white folks taken bread join the same bowl as them with their blacknigger fingers The folks at Warringtons are flatlanders after all and Devore tells the silent attentive young men that hes heard that in places like New York and Chicago white women sometimes even fuck blackniggers Naw Harry Auster says looking around nervously as if he expected a few white women to come tripping through the woods way out here on Bowie Ridge No white womand fuck a nigger Shoot a pickle Devore only gives him a look the kind that says When youre my age Besides he doesnt care what goes on in New York and Chicago he saw all the flatland he wanted to during the Civil War    and he will tell you he never fought that war to free the damned slaves They can keep slaves down there in the land of cotton until the end of the eternity as far as Jared Lancelot Devore is concerned No he fought in the war to teach those cracker sons of bitches south of Mason and Dixon that you dont pull out of the game just because you dont like some of the rules He went down to scratch the scab off the end of old Johnny Rebs nose Tried to leave the United States of America they had The Lord No he doesnt care about slaves and he doesnt care about the land of cotton and he doesnt care about blackniggers who sing dirty songs and then get treated to champagne and ersters Jared always says oysters in just that sarcastic way in payment for their smut He doesnt care about anything so long as they keep in their place and let him keep in his But she wont do it The uppity bitch will not do it She has been warned to stay off The Street but she will not listen She goes anyway walking along in her white dress just as if there was a white person inside it sometimes with her son who has a blacknigger African name and no daddy  his daddy probably just spent the one night with his mommy in a haystack somewhere down Alabama and now she walks around with the get of that just as bold as a brass monkey She walks The Street as if she has a right to be there even though not a soul will talk to her But thats not true is it I asked Devore Thats what really stuck in old greatgranddaddys craw wasnt it They did talk to her She had a way about her  that laugh maybe Men talked to her about crops and the women showed off their babies In fact they gave her their babies to hold and when she laughed down at them they laughed back up at her The girls asked her advice about boys The boys    they just looked But how they looked huh They filled up their eyes and I expect most of them thought about her when they went out to the privy and filled up their palms Devore glowered He was aging in front of me the lines drawing themselves deeper and deeper into his face he was becoming the man who had knocked me into the lake because he couldnt bear to be crossed And as he grew older he began to fade That was what Jared hated most of all wasnt it That they didnt turn aside didnt turn away She walked on The Street and no one treated her like a nigger They treated her like a neighbor I was in the zone deeper in than Id ever been down where the towns unconscious seemed to run like a buried river I could drink from that river while I was in the zone could fill my mouth and throat and belly with its cold minerally taste All that summer Devore had talked to them They were more than his crew they were his boys Fred and Harry and Ben and Oren and George Armbruster and Draper Finney who would break his neck and drown the next summer trying to dive into Eades Quarry while he was drunk Only it was the sort of accident thats kind of on purpose Draper Finney drank a lot between July of  and August of  because it was the only way he could sleep The only way he could get the hand out of his mind that hand sticking straight out of the water clenching and unclenching until you wanted to scream Wont it stop wont it ever stop doing that All summer long Jared Devore filled their ears with nigger bitch and uppity bitch All summer long he told them about their responsibility as men their duty to keep the community pure and how they must see what others didnt and do what others wouldnt It was a Sunday afternoon in August a time when traffic along The Street dropped steeply Later on by five or so things would begin to pick up again and from six to sunset the broad path along the lake would be thronged But three in the afternoon was Low tide The Methodists were back in session over in Harlow for their afternoon Song Service at Warringtons the assembled company of vacationing flatlanders was sitting down to a heavy midafternoon Sabbath meal of roast chicken or ham all over the township families were addressing their own Sunday dinners Those who had already finished were snoozing through the heat of the day  in a hammock wherever possible Sara liked this quiet time Loved it really She had spent a great deal of her life on carny midways and in smoky ginjoints shouting out her songs in order to be heard above the voices of redfaced unruly drunks and while part of her loved the excitement and unpredictability of that life part of her loved the serenity of this one too The peace of these walks She wasnt getting any younger after all she had a kid who had now left purt near all his babyhood behind him On that particular Sunday she must have thought The Street almost too quiet She walked a mile south from the meadow without seeing a soul even Kito was gone by then having stopped off to pick berries It was as if the whole township were deserted She knows theres an Eastern Star supper in Kashwakamak of course has even contributed a mushroom pie to it because she has made friends of some of the Eastern Star ladies Theyll all be down there getting ready What she doesnt know is that today is also Dedication Day for the new Grace Baptist Church the first real church ever to be built on the TR A slug of locals have gone heathen as well as Baptist Faintly from the other side of the lake she can hear the Methodists singing The sound is sweet and faint and beautiful distance and echo has tuned every sour voice She isnt aware of the men  most of them very young men the kind who under ordinary circumstances dare only look at her from the corners of their eyes  until the oldest one among them speaks Wellnow a black whore in a white dress and a red belt Damn if that aint just a little too much color for lakeside Whats wrong with you whore Cant you take a hint She turns toward him afraid but not showing it She has lived thirtysix years on this earth has known what a man has and where he wants to put it since she was eleven and she understands that when men are together like this and full of redeye she can smell it they give up thinking for themselves and turn into a pack of dogs If you show fear they will fall on you like dogs and likely tear you apart like dogs Also they have been laying for her There can be no other explanation for them turning up like this What hint is that sugar she asks standing her ground Where is everyone Where can they all be God damn Across the lake the Methodists have moved on to Trust and Obey a droner if there ever was one That you aint got no business walking where the white folks walk Harry Auster says His adolescent voice breaks into a kind of mousesqueak on the last word and she laughs She knows how unwise that is but she cant help it  shes never been able to help her laughter any more than shes ever been able to help the way men like this look at her breasts and bottom Blame it on God Why I walk where I do she says I was told this was common ground aint nobody got a right to keep me out Aint nobody has You seen em doin it You see us now George Armbruster says trying to sound tough Sara looks at him with a species of kindly contempt that makes George shrivel up inside His cheeks glow hot red Son she says you only come out now because the decent folks is all somewhere else Why do you want to let this old fella tell you what to do Act decent and let a lady walk I see it all As Devore fades and fades at last becoming nothing but eyes under a blue cap in the rainy afternoon through him I can see the shattered remains of my swimming float washing against the embankment I see it all I see her as she starts forward walking straight at Devore If she stands here jawing with them something bad is going to happen She feels it and she never questions her tidings And if she walks at any of the others ole massall bore in on her from the side pulling the rest after Ole massa in the little ole blue cap is the wheeldog the one she must face down She can do it too Hes strong strong enough to make these boys one creature his creature at least for the time being but he doesnt have her force her determination her energy In a way she welcomes this confrontation Reg has warned her to be careful not to move too fast or try to make real friends until the rednecks only Reggie calls them the bull gators show themselves  how many and how crazy  but she goes her own course trusts her own deep instincts And here they are only seven of em and really just the one bull gator Im stronger than you ole massa she thinks walking toward him She fixes her eyes on his and will not let them drop his are the ones that drop his the mouth that quivers uncertainly at one corner his the tongue that comes out as quick as a lizards tongue to wet the lips and all thats good    but even better is when he falls back a step When he does that the rest of them cluster in two groups of three and there it is her way through Faint and sweet are the Methodists faithy music carrying across the lakes still surface A droner of a hymn yes but sweet across the miles When we walk with the Lord in the light of His word what a glory He sheds on our way    Im stronger than you sugar she sends Im meaner than you you may be the bull gator but Im the queen bee and if you dont want me stingin on you you best clear me the rest of my path You bitch he says but his voice is weak he is already thinking this isnt the day theres something about her he didnt quite see until he saw her right up close some blacknigger hougan he didnt feel until now better wait for another day better  Then he trips over a root or a rock perhaps its the very rock behind which she will finally come to rest and falls down His cap falls off showing the big old bald spot on top of his head His pants split all the way up the seam And Sara makes a crucial mistake Perhaps she underestimates Jared Devores own very considerable personal force or perhaps she just cannot help herself  the sound of his britches ripping is like a loud fart In any case she laughs that raucous smokebroken laugh which is her trademark And her laugh becomes her doom Devore doesnt think He simply gives her the leather from where he lies big feet in pegged loggers boots shooting out like pistons He hits her where she is thinnest and most vulnerable in the ankles She hollers in shocked pain as the left one breaks she goes down in a tumble losing her furled parasol out of one hand She draws in breath to scream again and Jared says from where he is lying Dont let her Dassnt let her holler Ben Merrill falls on top of her fulllength all one hundred and ninety pounds of him The breath she has drawn to scream with whooshes out in a gusty almost silent sigh instead Ben who has never even danced with a woman let alone lain on top of one like this is instantly excited by the el of her struggling beneath him He wriggles against her laughing and when she rakes her nails down his cheek he barely feels it The way it seems to him hes all cock and a yard long When she tries to roll over and get out from under that way he rolls with her lets her be on top and he is totally surprised when she drives her forehead down on his He sees stars but he is eighteen years old as strong as he will ever be and he loses neither consciousness nor his erection Oren Peebles tears away the back of her dress laughing Pigpile he cries in a breathy little whisper and drops on top of her Now he is dryhumping her topside and Ben is dryhumping just as enthusiastically from underneath dryhumping like a billygoat even with the blood pouring down the sides of his head from the split in the center of his brow and she knows that if she cant scream she is lost If she can scream and if Kito hears hell run and get help run and get Reg  But before she can try again ole massa is squatting beside her and showing her a longbladed knife Make a sound and Ill cut your nose off he says and thats when she gives up They have brought her down after all partly because she laughed at the wrong time mostly out of pure buggardly bad luck Now they will not be stopped and best that Kito should stay away  please God keep him back where he was it was a good patch of berries one that should keep him occupied an hour or more He loves berrypicking and it wont take these men an hour Harry Auster yanks her hair back tears her dress off one shoulder and begins to sucker on her neck Ole massa the only one not at her Old massa standing back looking both ways along The Street his eyes slitted and wary old massa look like a mangy timberwolf done eaten a whole generation of chickenhouse chickens while managing to avoid every trap and snare Hey Irish quit on her a minute he tells Harry then widens his wise gaze to the others Get her in the puckies you damn fools Get her in there deep They dont They cant They are too eager to have her They armyank her behind the forehead of gray rock and call it good She doesnt pray easily but she prays now She prays for them to let her live She prays for Kito to stay clear to keep filling his bucket slow by eating every third handful She prays that if he does take a notion to catch up with her he will see whats happening and run the other way as fast as he can run silent and get Reg Stick this in your mouth George Armbruster pants And dont you bite me you bitch They take her top and bottom back and front two and three at a time They take her where anybody coming along cant help but see them and ole massa stands off a little looking first at the panting young men grouped around her kneeling with their trousers down and their thighs scratched from the bushes they are kneeling in then he peers up and down the path with his wild and wary eyes Incredibly one of them  it is Fred Dean  says Sorry maam after hes shot his load feels like halfway up to east bejeezus Its as if he accidentally kicked her in the shin while crossing his legs And it doesnt end Theres come down her throat come running down the crack of her ass the young one has bitten the blood right out of her left breast and it doesnt end They are young and by the time the last one has finished the first one oh God the first one is ready again Across the river the Methodists are now singing Blessed Assurance Jesus Is Mine and as ole massa approaches her she thinks Its almost over woman he the last hold on hold steady and it be over He looks at the skinny redhead and the one who keeps squinching his eye up and tossing his head and tells them to watch the path hes going to take his turn now that shes broke in He unbuckles his belt he unbuttons his flies he pushes down his underwear  dirty black at the knees and dirty yellow at the crotchand as he drops a knee on either side of her she sees that ole massa s little massa is just as floppy as a snake with its neck broke and before she can stop it that raucous laugh bursts all unexpected from her again  even lying here covered with the hot jelly spend of her rapists she cant help but see the funny side Shut up Devore growls at her and smashes the heel of one hard hand across her face breaking her cheekbone and her nose Shut up that howling Reckon it might get stiffer if it was one of your boys layin here with his rosy red ass stuck up in the air sugar she asks and then For the last time Sara laughs Devore draws his hand back to hit her again his naked loins lying against her naked loins his penis a flaccid worm between them But before he can bring the hand down a childs voice cries Ma What they doin to you Ma Git off my mama you bastards She sits up in spite of Devores weight her laughter dying her wide eyes searching Kito out and finding him a slim young boy of eight standing on The Street dressed in overalls and a straw hat and brandnew canvas shoes carrying a tin bucket in one hand His lips are blue with juice His eyes are wide with confusion and fright Run Kito she screams Run away h   Red fire explodes in her head she swoons back into the bushes hearing ole massa from a great distance Get him Dassnt let him ramble now Then shes going down a long dark slope shes lost in a Ghost House corridor that leads only deeper and deeper into its own convoluted bowels from that deep falling place she hears him she hears her darling one he is screaming I heard him screaming as I knelt by the gray rock with my carrybag beside me and no idea how Id gotten to where I was  I certainly had no memory of walking here I was crying in shock and horror and pity Was she crazy Well no wonder No fucking wonder The rain was steady but no longer apocalyptic I stared at my fishywhite hands on the gray rock for a few seconds then looked around Devore and the others were gone The ripe and gassy stench of decay filled my nose  it was like a physical assault I fumbled in the carrybag found the Stenomask Rommie and George had given me as a joke and slipped it over my mouth and nose with fingers that felt numb and distant I breathed shallowly and tentatively Better Not a lot but enough to keep from fleeing which was undoubtedly what she wanted No she cried from somewhere behind me as I grabbed the spade and dug in I tore a great mouth in the ground with the first swipe and each subsequent one deepened and widened it The earth was soft and yielding woven through with mats of thin roots which parted easily under the blade No Dont you dare I wouldnt look around wouldnt give her a chance to push me away She was stronger down here perhaps because it had happened here Was that possible I didnt know and didnt care All I cared about was getting this done Where the roots were thicker I hacked through them with the pruning knife Leave me be Now I did look around risked one quick glance because of the unnatural crackling sounds which had accompanied her voice  which now seemed to make her voice The Green Lady was gone The birch had somehow become Sara Tidwell it was Saras face growing out of the crisscrossing branches and shiny leaves That rainslicked face swayed dissolved came together melted away came together again For a moment all the mystery I had sensed down here was revealed Her damp shifting eyes were utterly human They stared at me with hate and supplication I aint done she cried in a cracked breaking voice He was the worst dont you understand He was the worst and its his blood in her and I wont rest until I have it out There was a gruesome ripping sound She had inhabited the birch made it into a physical body of some sort and intended to tear it free of the earth She would come and get me with it if she could kill me with it if she could Strangle me in limber branches Stuff me with leaves until I looked like a Christmas decoration No matter how much of a monster he was Kyra had nothing to do with what he did I said And you wont have her Yes I will the Green Lady screamed The ripping rending sounds were louder now They were joined by a hissing shaky crackle I didnt look around again I didnt dare look around I dug faster instead Yes I will have her she cried and now the voice was closer She was coming for me but I refused to see when it comes to walking trees and bushes Ill stick to Macbeth thanks I will have her He took mine and I mean to take his Go away a new voice said The spade loosened in my hands almost fell I turned and saw Jo standing below me and to my right She was looking at Sara who had materialized into a lunatics hallucination  a monstrous greenishblack thing that slipped with every step it tried to walk along The Street She had left the birch behind yet assumed its vitality somehow  the actual tree huddled behind her black and shrivelled and dead The creature born of it looked like the Bride of Frankenstein as sculpted by Picasso In it Saras face came and went came and went The Shape I thought coldly It was always real    and if it was always me it was always her too Jo was dressed in the white shirt and yellow slacks shed had on the day she died I couldnt see the lake through her as I had been able to see it through Devore and Devores young friends she had materialized herself completely I felt a curious draining sensation at the back of my skull and thought I knew how Git out bitch the Sarathing snarled It raised its arms toward Jo as it had raised them to me in my worst nightmares Not at all Jos voice remained calm She turned toward me Hurry Mike You have to be quick Its not really her anymore Shes let one of the Outsiders in and theyre very dangerous Jo I love you I love you t   Sara shrieked and then began to spin Leaves and branches blurred together and lost coherence it was like watching something liquefy in a blender The entity which had only looked a little like a woman to begin with now dropped its masquerade entirely Something elemental and grotesquely inhuman began to form out of the maelstrom It leaped at my wife When it struck her the color and solidity left Jo as if slapped away by a huge hand She became a phantom struggling with the thing which raved and shrieked and clawed at her Hurry Mike she screamed Hurry I bent to the job The spade struck something that wasnt dirt wasnt stone wasnt wood I scraped along it revealing a filthy moldcrusted swatch of canvas Now I dug like a madman wanting to clear as much of the buried object as I could wanting to fatten my chances of success as much as I could Behind me the Shape screamed in fury and my wife screamed in pain Sara had given up part of her discorporate self in order to gain her revenge had let in something Jo called an Outsider I had no idea what that might be and never wanted to know Sara was its conduit I knew that much And if I could take care of her in time  I reached into the dripping hole slapping wet earth from the ancient canvas Faint stencilled letters appeared when I did JM MCCURDIE SAWMILL Mccurdies had burned in the fires of  I knew Id seen a picture of it in flames somewhere As I seized the canvas the tips of my fingers punching through and letting out a fresh billow of green and gassy stench I could hear grunting I could hear Devore Hes lying on top of her and grunting like a pig Sara is semiconscious muttering unintelligibly through bruised lips which are shiny with blood Devore is looking back over his shoulder at Draper Finney and Fred Dean They have raced after the boy and brought him back but he wont stop yelling hes yelling to beat the band yelling to wake the dead and if they can hear the Methodists singing How I Love to Tell the Story over here then they may be able to hear the yowling nigger over there Devore says Put him in the water shut him up The minute he says it as though the words are magic words his cock begins to stiffen What do you mean Ben Merrill asks You know goddam well Jared says He pants the words out jerking his hips as he speaks His narrow ass gleams in the afternoon light He seen us You want to cut his throat get his blood all over you Fine by me Here Take my knife be my guest NNo Jared Ben cries in horror actually seeming to cringe at the sight of the knife He is finally ready It takes him a little longer thats all he aint a kid like these other ones But now   Never mind her smart mouth never mind her insolent way of laughing never mind the whole township Let them all show up and watch if they like He slips it to her what shes wanted all along what all her kind want He slips it in and sinks it deep He continues giving orders even as he rapes her Up and down his ass goes ticktock just like a cats tail Somebody take care of him Or do you want to spend forty years rotting in Shawshank because of a nigger boys tattle Ben seizes one of Kito Tidwells arms Oren Peebles the other but by the time they have dragged him as far as the embankment they have lost their heart Raping an uppity nigger woman with the gall to laugh at Jared when he fell down and split his britches is one thing Drowning a scared kid like a kitten in a mudpuddle    thats another one altogether They loosen their grip staring into each others haunted eyes and Kito pulls free Run honey Sara cries Run away and get  Jared clamps his hands around her throat and begins choking The boy trips over his own berry bucket and thumps gracelessly to the ground Harry and Draper recapture him easily What you going to do  Draper asks in a kind of desperate whine and Harry replies What I have to Thats what he replied and now I was going to do what I had to  in spite of the stench in spite of Sara in spite of my dead wifes shrieks I hauled the roll of canvas out of the ground The ropes which had tied it shut at either end held but the roll itself split down the middle with a hideous burping sound Hurry Jo cried I cant hold it much longer It snarled it bayed like a dog There was a loud wooden crunch like a door being slammed hard enough to splinter and Jo wailed I grabbed for the carrybag with Slips n Greens printed on the front and tore it open as Harry  the others call him Irish because of his carrotcolored hair  grabs the struggling kid in a clumsy kind of bearhug and jumps into the lake with him The kid struggles harder than ever his straw hat comes off and floats on the water Get that Harry pants Fred Dean kneels and fishes out the dripping hat Freds eyes are dazed hes got the look of a fighter about one round from hitting the canvas Behind them Sara Tidwell has begun to rattle deep in her chest and throat like the sight of the boys clenching hand these sounds will haunt Draper Finney until his final dive into Eades Quarry Jared sinks his fingers deeper pumping and choking at the same time the sweat pouring off him No amount of washing will take the smell of that sweat out of these clothes and when he begins to think of it as murdersweat he burns the clothes to get shed of it Harry Auster wants to be shed of it all to be shed of it and never see these men again most of all Jared Devore who he now thinks must be Lord Satan himself Harry cannot go home and face his father unless this nightmare is over buried And his mother How can he ever face his beloved mother Bridget Auster with her round sweet Irish face and graying hair and comforting shelf of bosom Bridget who has always had a kind word or a soothing handler him Bridget Auster who has been Saved shed in the Blood of the Lamb Bridget Auster who is even now serving pies at the picnic theyre having at the new church Bridget Auster who is mamma how can he ever look at her again  or she him  if he has to stand in court on a charge of raping and beating a woman even a black woman So he yanks the clinging boy away  Kito scratches him once just a nick on the side of the neck and that night Harry will tell his mamma it was a bushpricker that caught him unawares and he will let her put a kiss on it  and then he plunges the child into the lake Kito looks up at him his face shimmering and Harry sees a little fish flick by A perch he thinks For an instant he wonders what the boy must see looking up through the silver shield of the surface at the face of the fellow whos holding him down the fellow whos drowning him and then Harry pushes that away Just a nigger he reminds himself desperately Thats all he is just a nigger No kin of yours Kitos arm comes out of the water  his dripping darkbrown arm Harry pulls back not wanting to be clawed but the hand doesnt reach for him only sticks straight up The fingers curl into a fist Open Curl into a fist Open Curl into a fist The boys thrashing begins to ease the kicking feet begin to slow down the eyes looking up into Harrys eyes are taking on a curiously dreamy look and still that brown arm sticks straight up still the hand opens and closes opens and closes Draper Finney stands on the shore crying sure that now someone will come along now someone will see the terrible thing they have done  the terrible thing they are in fact still doing Be sure your sin will find you out it says in the Good Book Be sure He opens his mouth to tell Harry to quit maybe its still not too late to take it back let him up let him live but no sound comes out Behind him Sara is choking her last In front of him her drowning sons hand opens and closes opens and closes the reflection of it shimmering on the water and Draper thinks Wont it stop doing that wont it ever stop doing that And as if it were a prayer that something is now answering the boys locked elbow begins to bend and his arm begins to sag the fingers begin to close again into a fist and then stop For a moment the hand wavers and then I slammed the heel of my hand into the center of my forehead to clear these phantoms away Behind me there was a frenzied snap and crackle of wet bushes as Jo and whatever she was holding back continued to struggle I put my hands inside the split in the canvas like a doctor spreading a wound I yanked There was a low ripping sound as the roll tore the rest of the way up and down Inside was what remained of them  two yellowed skulls forehead to forehead as if in intimate conversation a womans faded red leather belt a molder of clothes    and a heap of bones Two ribcages one large and one small Two sets of legs one long and one short The early remains of Sara and Kito Tidwell buried here by the lake for almost a hundred years The larger of the two skulls turned It glared at me with its empty eyesockets Its teeth chattered as if it would bite me and the bones below it began a tenebrous jittery stirring Some broke apart immediately all were soft and pitted The red belt stirred restlessly and the rusty buckle rose like the head of a snake Mike Jo screamed Quick quick I pulled the sack out of the carrybag and grabbed the plastic bottle which had been inside Lye stille the Magnabet letters had said another little wordtrick Another message passed behind the unsuspecting guards back Sara Tidwell was a fearsome creature but she had underestimated Jo    and she had underestimated the telepathy of long association as well I had gone to Slips n Greens I had bought a bottle of lye and now I opened it and poured it smoking over the bones of Sara and her son There was a hissing sound like the one you hear when you open a beer or a bottled soft drink The beltbuckle melted The bones turned white and crumpled like things made out of sugar  I had a nightmare image of Mexican children eating candy corpses off long sticks on the Day of the Dead The eyesockets of Saras skull widened as the lye filled the dark hollow where her mind her prodigious talent and her laughing soul had once resided It was an expression that looked at first like surprise and then like sorrow The jaw fell off the nubs of the teeth sizzled away The top of the skull caved in Spread fingerbones jittered then melted Ohhhhhh     It whispered through the soaking trees like a rising wind    only the wind had died as the wet air caught its breath before the next onslaught It was a sound of unspeakable grief and longing and surrender I sensed no hate in it her hate was gone burned away in the corrosive I had bought in Helen Austers shop The sound of Saras going was replaced by the plaintive almost human cry of a bird and it awakened me from the place where I had been brought me finally and completely out of the zone I got shakily to my feet turned around and looked at The Street Jo was still there a dim form through which I could now see the lake and the dark clouds of the next thundersquall coming over the mountains Something flickered beyond her  that bird venturing out of its safe covert for a peek at the rearranged environment perhaps  but I barely registered that It was Jo I wanted to see Jo who had come God knew how far and suffered God knew how much to help me She looked exhausted hurt in some fundamental way diminished But the other thing  the Outsider  was gone Jo standing in a ring of birch leaves so dead they looked charred turned to me and smiled Jo We did it Her mouth moved I heard the sound but the words were too distant to make out She was standing right there but she might have been calling across a wide canyon Still I understood her I read the words off her lips if you prefer the rational right out of her mind if you prefer the romantical I prefer the latter Marriage is a zone too you know Marriage is a zone  So thats all right isnt it I glanced down into the gaping roll of canvas and saw nothing but stubs and splinters sticking out of a noxious uneasy paste I got a whiff and even through the Stenomask it made me cough and back away Not corruption lye When I looked back around at Jo she was barely there Jo Wait  Cant help Cant stay Words from another star system barely glimpsed on a fading mouth Now she was little more than eyes floating in the dark afternoon eyes which seemed made of the lake behind them  Hurry    She was gone I slipped and stumbled to the place where shed been my feet crunching over dead birch leaves and grabbed at nothing What a fool I must have looked soaked to the skin wearing a Stenomask askew over the lower half of my face trying to embrace the wet gray air I got the faintest whiff of Red perfume    and then only damp earth lakewater and the vile stink of lye running under everything At least the smell of putrefaction was gone that had been no more real than    Than what Than what Either it was all real or none of it was real If none of it was real I was out of my mind and ready for the Blue Wing at Juniper Hill I looked over toward the gray rock and saw the bag of bones I had pulled out of the wet ground like a festering tooth Lazy tendrils of smoke were still rising from its ripped length That much was real So was the Green Lady who was now a sootcolored Black Lady  as dead as the dead branch behind her the one that seemed to point like an arm Cant help    cant stay    hurry Couldnt help with what What more help did I need It was done wasnt it Sara was gone spirit follows bone good night sweet ladies God grant she lye stille And still a kind of stinking terror not so different from the smell of putrescence which had come out of the ground seemed to sweat out of the air Kyras name began to beat in my head KiKi KiKi KiKi like the call of some exotic tropical bird I started up the railroadtie steps to the house and although I was exhausted by the time I was halfway up I had begun to run I climbed the stairs to the deck and went in that way The house looked the same  save for the broken tree poking in through the kitchen window Sara Laughs had stood up to the storm very well  but something was wrong There was something I could almost smell    and perhaps I did smell it bitter and low Lunacy may have its own wildvetch aroma Its not the kind of thing I would ever care to research In the front hall I stopped looking down at a heap of paperback books Elmore Leonards and Ed Mcbains lying on the floor As if they had been raked off the shelf by a passing hand A flailing hand maybe I could also see my tracks there both coming and going They had already begun to dry They should have been the only ones I had been carrying Ki when we came in They should have been but they werent The others were smaller but not so small that I mistook them for a childs I ran down the hall to the north bedroom crying her name and I might as well have been crying Mattie or Jo or Sara Coming out of my mouth Kyras name sounded like the name of a corpse The duvet had been thrown back onto the floor Except for the black stuffed dog lying where it had in my dream the bed was empty And Ki was gone I reached for Ki with the part of my mind that had for the last few weeks known what she was wearing what room of the trailer she was in and what she was doing there There was nothing of course that link was also dissolved I called for Jo  I think I did  but Jo was gone too I was on my own God help me God help us both I could feel panic trying to descend and fought it off I had to keep my mind clear If I couldnt think any chance Ki might still have would be lost I walked rapidly back down the hall to the foyer trying not to hear the sick voice in the back of my head the one saying that Ki was lost already dead already I knew no such thing couldnt know it now that the connection between us was broken I looked down at the heap of books then up at the door The new tracks had come in this way and gone out this way too Lightning stroked the sky and thunder cracked The wind was rising again I went to the door reached for the knob then paused Something was caught in the crack between the door and the jamb something as fine and floaty as a strand of spiders silk A single white hair I looked at it with a sick lack of surprise I should have known of course and if not for the strain Id been under and the successive shocks of this terrible day I would have known It was all on the tape John had played for me that morning    a time that already seemed part of another mans life For one thing there was the timecheck marking the point where John had hung up on her Nineforty AM Eastern Daylight the robot voice had said which meant that Rogette had been calling at sixforty in the morning    if that was shed really been calling from Palm Springs That was at least possible had the oddity occurred to me while we were driving from the airport to Matties trailer I would have told myself that there were no doubt insomniacs all over California who finished their East Coast business before the sun had hauled itself fully over the horizon and good for them But there was something else that couldnt be explained away so easily At one point John had ejected the tape He did it because he said Id gone as white as a sheet instead of looking amused I had told him to go on and play the rest it had just surprised me to hear her again The quality of her voice Christ the reproduction is good Except it was really the boys in the basement who had reacted to Johns tape my subconscious coconspirators And it hadnt been her voice that had scared them badly enough to turn my face white The underhum had done that The characteristic underhum you always got on TR calls both those you made and those you received Rogette Whitmore had never left TR at all If my failing to realize that this morning cost Ki Devore her life this afternoon I wouldnt be able to live with myself I told God that over and over as I went plunging down the railroadtie steps again running into the face of a revitalized storm Its a blueeyed wonder I didnt go flying right off the embankment Half my swimming float had grounded there and perhaps I could have impaled myself on its splintered boards and died like a vampire writhing on a stake What a pleasant thought that was Running isnt good for people near panic its like scratching poison ivy By the time I had thrown my arm around one of the pines at the foot of the steps to check my progress I was on the edge of losing all coherent thought Kis name was beating in my head again so loudly there wasnt room for much else Then a stroke of lightning leaped out of the sky to my right and knocked the last three feet of trunk out from beneath a huge old spruce which had probably been here when Sara and Kito were still alive If Id been looking directly at it I would have been blinded even with my head turned threequarters away the stroke left a huge blue swatch like the aftermath of a gigantic camera flash floating in front of my eyes There was a grinding juddering sound as two hundred feet of blue spruce toppled into the lake sending up a long curtain of spray which seemed to hang between the gray sky and gray water The stump was on fire in the rain burning like a witchs hat It had the effect of a slap clearing my head and giving me one final chance to use my brain I took a breath and forced myself to do just that Why had I come down here in the first place Why did I think Rogette had brought Kyra toward the lake where I had just been instead of carrying her away from me up the driveway to Lane Fortytwo Dont be stupid She came down here because The Streets the way back to Warringtons and Warringtons is where shes been all by herself ever since she sent the bosss body back to California in his private jet She had sneaked into the house while I was under Jos studio finding the tin box in the belly of the owl and studying that scrap of genealogy She would have taken Ki then if Id given her the chance but I didnt I came hurrying back afraid something was wrong afraid someone might be trying to get hold of the kid  Had Rogette awakened her Had Ki seen her and tried to warn me before drifting off again Was that what had brought me in such a hurry Maybe Id still been in the zone then wed still been linked then Rogette had certainly been in the house when I came back She might even have been in the northbedroom closet and peering at me through the crack Part of me had known it too Part of me had felt her felt something that was notSara Then Id left again Grabbed the carrybag from Slips n Greens and come down here Turned right turned north Toward the birch the rock the bag of bones Id done what I had to do and while I was doing it Rogette carried Kyra down the railroadtie steps behind me and turned left on The Street Turned south toward Warringtons With a sinking feeling deep in my belly I realized I had probably heard Ki    might even have seen her That bird peeking timidly out from cover during the lull had been no bird Ki was awake by then Ki had seen me  perhaps had seen Jo as well  and tried to call out She had managed just that one little peep before Rogette had covered her mouth How long ago had that been It seemed like forever but I had an idea it hadnt been long at all  less than five minutes maybe But it doesnt take long to drown a child The image of Kitos bare arm sticking straight out of the water tried to come back  the hand at the end of it opening and closing opening and closing as if it were trying to breathe for the lungs that couldnt  and I pushed it away I also suppressed the urge to simply sprint in the direction of Warringtons Panic would take me for sure if I did that In all the years since her death I had never longed for Jo with the bitter intensity I felt then But she was gone there wasnt even a whisper of her With no one to depend on but myself I started south along the treelittered Street skirting the blowdowns where I could crawling under them if they blocked my way entirely taking the noisy branchbreaking course over the top only as a last resort As I went I issued what I imagine are all the standard prayers in such a situation but none of them seemed to get past the image of Rogette Whitmores face rising in my mind Her screaming merciless face I remember thinking This is the outdoor version of the Ghost House Certainly the woods seemed haunted to me as I struggled along trees only loosened in the first grand blow were falling by the score in this followup cap of wind and rain The noise was like great crunching footfalls and I didnt need to worry about the noise my own feet were making When I passed the Batchelders camp a circular prefab construction sitting on an outcrop of rock like a hat on a footstool I saw that the entire roof had been bashed flat by a hemlock Half a mile south of Sara I saw one of Kis white hair ribbons lying in the path I picked it up thinking how much that red edging looked like blood Then I stuffed it into my pocket and went on Five minutes later I came to an old mosscaked pine that had fallen across the path it was still connected to its stump by a stretched and bent network of splinters and squalled like a line of rusty hinges as the surging water lifted and dropped what had been its upper twenty or thirty feet now floating in the lake There was space to crawl under and when I dropped to my knees I saw other kneetracks just beginning to fill with water I saw something else the second hair ribbon I tucked it into my pocket with the first I was halfway under the pine when I heard another tree go over this one much closer The sound was followed by a scream  not pain or fear but surprised anger Then even over the hiss of the rain and the wind I could hear Rogettes voice Come back Dont go out there its dangerous I squirmed the rest of the way under the tree barely feeling the stump of a branch which tore a groove in my lower back got to my feet and sprinted along the path If the fallen trees I came to were small I hurdled them without slowing down If they were bigger I scrabbled over with no thought to where they might claw or dig in Thunder whacked There was a brilliant stroke of lightning and in its glare I saw gray barnboard through the trees On the day Id first seen Rogette Id only been able to catch glimpses of Warringtons lodge but now the forest had been torn open like an old garment  this area would be years recovering The lodges rear half had been pretty well demolished by a pair of huge trees that seemed to have fallen together They had crossed like a knife and fork on a diners plate and lay on the ruins in a shaggy X Kis voice rising over the storm only because it was shrill with terror Go away I dont want you white nana Go away It was horrible to hear the terror in her voice but wonderful to hear her voice at all About forty feet from where Rogettes shout had frozen me in place one more tree lay across the path Rogette herself stood on the far side of it holding a hand out to Ki The hand was dripping blood but I hardly noticed It was Kyra I noticed The dock running between The Street and The Sunset Bar was a long one  seventy feet at least perhaps a hundred Long enough so that on a pretty summer evening you could stroll it handinhand with your date or your lover and make a memory The storm hadnt torn it away  not yet  but the wind had twisted it like a ribbon I remember newsreel footage at some childhood Saturday matinee film of a suspension bridge dancing in a hurricane and that was what the dock between Warringtons and The Sunset Bar looked like It jounced up and down in the surging water groaning in all its slatted joints like a wooden accordion There had been a rail  presumably to guide those whod made a heavy night of it safely back to shore  but it was gone now Kyra was halfway out along this swaying dipping length of wood I could see at least three rectangles of blackness between the shore and where she stood places where boards had snapped off From beneath the dock came the disturbed clungclungclung of the empty steel drums that were holding it up Several of these drums had come unanchored and were floating away Ki had her arms stretched out for balance like a tightrope walker in the circus The black HarleyDavidson teeshirt flapped around her knees and sunburned shoulders Come back Rogette cried Her lank hair flew around her head the shiny black raincoat she was wearing rippled She was holding both hands out now one bloody and one not I had an idea Ki might have bitten her No white nana Ki shook her head in wild negation and I wanted to tell her dont do that Kibird dont shake your head like that very bad idea She tottered one arm pointed up at the sky and one down at the water so she looked for a moment like an airplane in a steep bank If the dock had picked that moment to take a hard buck beneath her Ki would have spilled off the side She regained some precarious balance instead although I thought I saw her bare feet slide a little on the slick boards Go away white nana I dont want you Go    go take a nap you look tired Ki didnt see me all her attention was fixed on the white nana The white nana didnt see me either I dropped to my belly and squirmed under the tree pulling myself along with my clawed hands Thunder rolled across the lake like a big mahogany ball the sound echoing off the mountains When I got to my knees again I saw that Rogette was advancing slowly toward the shore end of the dock For every step she took forward Kyra took a shaky dangerous step backward Rogette was holding her good hand out though for a moment I thought this one had begun to bleed as well The stuff running through her bunchy fingers was too dark for blood however and when she began to talk speaking in a hideous coaxing voice that made my skin crawl I realized it was melting chocolate Lets play the game Kibird Rogette cooed Do you want to start She took a step Ki took a compensatory step backward tottered caught her balance My heart stopped then resumed racing I closed the distance between myself and the woman as rapidly as I could but I didnt run I didnt want her to know a thing until she woke up If she woke up I didnt care if she did or not Hell if I could fracture the back of George Footmans skull with a hammer I could certainly put a hurt on this horror As I walked I laced my hands together into one large fist No Dont want to start Too shy Rogette spoke in a sugary Romper Room voice that made me want to grind my teeth together All right Ill start Happy What rhymes with happy Kibird Pappy    and nappy    you were taking a nappy werent you when I came and woke you up And lappy    would you want to come and sit on my lappy Kibird Well feed each other chocolate just like we used to    Ill tell you a new knockknock joke     Another step She had come to the edge of the dock If shed thought of it she could simply have thrown rocks at Kyra as she had at me thrown until she connected with one and knocked Ki into the lake But I dont think she got even close to such a notion Once crazy goes past a certain point youre on a turnpike with no exit ramps Rogette had other plans for Kyra Come on KiKi play the game with white nana She held out the chocolate again gooey Hersheys Kisses dripping through crumpled foil Kyras eyes shifted and at last she saw me I shook my head trying to tell her to be quiet but it was no good  an expression of joyous relief crossed her face She cried out my name and I saw Rogettes shoulders go up in surprise I ran the last dozen feet raising my joined hands like a club but I slipped a little on the wet ground at the crucial moment and Rogette made a kind of ducking cringe Instead of striking her at the back of the neck as Id meant to my joined hands only glanced off her shoulder She staggered went to one knee and was up again almost at once Her eyes were like little blue arclamps spitting rage instead of electricity You she said hissing the word over the top of her tongue turning it into the sound of some ancient curse Heeyuuuu Behind us Kyra screamed my name staggerdancing on the wet wood and waving her arms in an effort to keep from falling in the lake Water slopped onto the deck and ran over her small bare feet Hold on Ki I called back Rogette saw my attention shift and took her chance  she spun and ran out onto the dock I sprang after her grabbed her by the hair and it came off in my hand All of it I stood there at the edge of the surging lake with her mat of white hair dangling from my fist like a scalp Rogette looked over her shoulder snarling an ancient bald gnome in the rain and I thought Its him its Devore he never died at all somehow he and the woman swapped identities she was the one who committed suicide it was her body that went back to California on the jet  Even as she turned the other way again and began to run toward Ki I knew better It was Rogette all right but shed come by that hideous resemblance honestly Whatever was wrong with her had done more than make her hair fall out it had aged her as well Seventy Id thought but that had to be at least ten years beyond the actual mark Ive known a lot of folks name their kids alike Mrs M had told me They think its cute Max Devore must have thought so too because he had named a son Roger and his daughter Rogette Perhaps shed come by the Whitmore part honestly  she might have been married in her younger years  but once the wig was gone her antecedents were beyond argument The woman tottering along the wet dock to finish the job was Kyras aunt Ki began to back up rapidly making no effort to be careful and pick her footing She was going into the drink there was no way she could stay up But before she could fall a wave slapped the dock between them at a place where some of the barrels had come loose and the slatted walkway was already partly submerged Foamy water flew up and began to twist into one of those helix shapes I had seen before Rogette stopped ankledeep in the water sloshing over the dock and I stopped about twelve feet behind her The shape solidified and even before I could make out the face I recognized the baggy shorts with their fading swirls of color and the smock top Only Kmart sells smock tops of such perfect shapelessness I think it may be a federal law It was Mattie A grave gray Mattie looking at Rogette with grave gray eyes Rogette raised her hands tottered tried to turn At that moment a wave surged under the dock making it rise and then drop like an amusementpark ride Rogette went over the side Beyond her beyond the watershape in the rain I could see Ki sprawling on the porch of The Sunset Bar That last heave had flipped her to temporary safety like a human tiddlywink Mattie was looking at me her lips moving her eyes on mine I had been able to tell what Jo was saying but this time I had no idea I tried with all my might but I couldnt make it out Mommy Mommy The figure didnt so much turn as revolve it didnt actually seem to be there below the hem of the long shorts It moved up the dock to the bar where Ki was now standing with her arms held out Something grabbed at my foot I looked down and saw a drowning apparition in the surging water Dark eyes stared up at me from beneath the bald skull Rogette was coughing water from between lips that were as purple as plums Her free hand waved weakly up at me The fingers opened    and closed Opened    and closed I dropped to one knee and took it It clamped over mine like a steel claw and she yanked trying to pull me in with her The purple lips peeled back from yellow toothpegs like those in Saras skull And yes  I thought that this time Rogette was the one laughing I rocked on my haunches and yanked her up I didnt think about it it was pure instinct I had her by at least a hundred pounds and three quarters of her came out of the lake like a gigantic freakish trout She screamed darted her head forward and buried her teeth in my wrist The pain was immediate and enormous I jerked my arm up even higher and then brought it down not thinking about hurting her wanting only to rid myself of that weasels mouth Another wave hit the halfsubmerged dock as I did Its rising splintered edge impaled Rogettes descending face One eye popped a dripping yellow splinter ran up her nose like a dagger the scant skin of her forehead split snapping away from the bone like two suddenly released windowshades Then the lake pulled her away I saw the torn topography of her face a moment longer upturned into the torrential rain wet and as pale as the light from a fluorescent bar Then she rolled over her black vinyl raincoat swirling around her like a shroud What I saw when I looked back toward The Sunset Bar was another glimpse under the skin of this world but one far different from the face of Sara in the Green Lady or the snarling halfglimpsed shape of the Outsider Kyra stood on the wide wooden porch in front of the bar amid a litter of overturned wicker furniture In front of her was a waterspout in which I could still see  very faintly  the fading shape of a woman She was on her knees holding her arms out They tried to embrace Kis arms went through Mattie and came out dripping Mommy I cant get you The woman in the water was speaking  I could see her lips moving Ki looked at her rapt Then for just a moment Mattie turned to me Our eyes met and hers were made of the lake They were Dark Score which was here long before I came and will remain long after I am gone I put my hands to my mouth kissed my palms and held them out to her Shimmery hands went up as if to catch those kisses Mommy dont go Kyra screamed and flung her arms around the figure She was immediately drenched and backed away with her eyes squinched shut coughing There was no longer a woman with her there was only water running across the boards and dripping through the cracks to rejoin the lake which comes up from deep springs far below from the fissures in the rock which underlies the TR and all this part of our world Moving carefully doing my own balancing act I made my way out along the wavering dock to The Sunset Bar When I got there I took Kyra in my arms She hugged me tight shivering fiercely against me I could hear the small dicecup rattle of her teeth and smell the lake in her hair Mattie came she said I know I saw her Mattie made the white nana go away I saw that too Be very still now Ki Were going back to solid ground but you cant move around a lot If you do well end up swimming She was good as gold When we were on The Street again and I tried to put her down she clung to my neck fiercely That was okay with me I thought of taking her into Warringtons but didnt There would be towels in there probably dry clothes as well but I had an idea there might also be a bathtub full of warm water waiting in there Besides the rain was slackening again and this time the sky looked lighter in the west What did Mattie tell you hon I asked as we walked north along The Street Ki would let me put her down so we could crawl under the downed trees we came to but raised her arms to be picked up again on the far side of each To be a good girl and not be sad But I am sad Im very sad She began to cry and I stroked her wet hair By the time we got to the railroadtie steps she had cried herself out    and over the mountains in the west I could see one small but very brilliant wedge of blue All the woods fell down Ki said looking around Her eyes were very wide Well    not all but a lot of them I guess Halfway up the steps I paused puffing and seriously winded I didnt ask Ki if I could put her down though I didnt want to put her down I just wanted to catch my breath Mike What doll Mattie told me something else What Can I whisper If you want to sure Ki leaned close put her lips to my ear and whispered I listened When she was done I nodded kissed her cheek shifted her to the other hip and carried her the rest of the way up to the house Twasnt the stawm of the century chummy and dont you go thinkin that it was Nossir So said the oldtimers who sat in front of the big Army medics tent that served as the Lakeview General that late summer and fall A huge elm had toppled across Route  and bashed the store in like a Saltines box Adding injury to insult the elm had carried a bunch of spitting live lines with it They ignited propane from a ruptured tank and the whole thing went kaboom The tent was a pretty good warmweather substitute though and folks on the TR took to saying they was going down to the MASH for bread and beer  this because you could still see a faded red cross on both sides of the tents roof The oldtimers sat along one canvas wall in folding chairs waving to other oldtimers when they went pooting by in their rusty oldtimer cars all certified oldtimers own either Fords or Chevys so Im well on my way in that regard swapping their undershirts for flannels as the days began to cool toward cider season and spuddigging watching the township start to rebuild itself around them And as they watched they talked about the ice storm of the past winter the one that knocked out lights and splintered a million trees between Kittery and Fort Kent they talked about the cyclones that touched down in August of  they talked about the sleet hurricane of  Now there was some stawms they said There was some stawms by Gorry Im sure theyve got a point and I dont argue with them  you rarely win an argument with a genuine Yankee oldtimer never if its about the weather  but for me the storm of July   will always be the storm And I know a little girl who feels the same She may live until  given all the benefits of modern medicine but I think that for Kyra Elizabeth Devore that will always be the storm The one where her dead mother came to her dressed in the lake The first vehicle to come down my driveway didnt arrive until almost six oclock It turned out to be not a Castle County police car but a yellow bucketloader with flashing yellow lights on top of the cab and a guy in a Central Maine Power Company slicker working the controls The guy in the other seat was a cop though  was in fact Norris Ridgewick the County Sheriff himself And he came to my door with his gun drawn The change in the weather the TV guy had promised had already arrived clouds and stormcells driven east by a chilly wind running just under gale force Trees had continued to fall in the dripping woods for at least an hour after the rain stopped Around five oclock I made us toastedcheese sandwiches and tomato soup    comfort food Jo would have called it Kyra ate listlessly but she did eat and she drank a lot of milk I had wrapped her in another of my teeshirts and she tied her own hair back I offered her the white ribbons but she shook her head decisively and opted for a rubber band instead I dont like those ribbons anymore she said I decided I didnt either and threw them away Ki watched me do it and offered no objection Then I crossed the living room to the woodstove What are you doing She finished her second glass of milk wriggled off her chair and came over to me Making a fire Maybe all those hot days thinned my blood Thats what my mom would have said anyway She watched silently as I pulled sheet after sheet from the pile of paper Id taken off the table and stacked on top of the woodstove balled each one up and slipped it in through the door When I felt Id loaded enough I began to lay bits of kindling on top Whats written on those papers Ki asked Nothing important Is it a story Not really It was more like    oh I dont know A crossword puzzle Or a letter Pretty long letter she said and then laid her head against my leg as if she were tired Yeah I said Love letters usually are but keeping them around is a bad idea Why Because they     Can come back to haunt you was what rose to mind but I wouldnt say it Because they can embarrass you in later life Oh Besides I said These papers are like your ribbons in a way You dont like them anymore Right She saw the box then  the tin box with JOS NOTIONS written on the front It was on the counter between the living room and the sink not far from where old Krazy Kat had hung on the wall I didnt remember bringing the box up from the studio with me but I suppose I might not have I was pretty freaked I also think it could have come up    kind of by itself I do believe such things now I have reason to Kyras eyes lit up in a way they hadnt since she had wakened from her short nap to find out her mother was dead She stood on tiptoe to take hold of the box then ran her small fingers across the gilt letters I thought about how important it was for a kid to own a tin box You had to have one for your secret stuff the best toy the prettiest bit of lace the first piece of jewelry Or a picture of your mother perhaps This is so    pretty she said in a soft awed voice You can have it if you dont mind it saying JOS NOTIONS instead of KIS NOTIONS There are some papers in it I want to read but I could put them somewhere else She looked at me to make sure I wasnt kidding saw I wasnt Id love it she said in the same soft awed voice I took the box from her scooped out the steno books notes and clippings then handed it back to Ki She practiced taking the lid off and then putting it back on Guess what Ill put in here she said Secret treasures Yes she said and actually smiled for a moment Who was Jo Mike Do I know her I do dont I She was one of the fridgearator people She   A thought occurred I shuffled through the yellowed clippings Nothing I thought Id lost it somewhere along the way then saw a corner of what I was looking for peeking from the middle of one of the steno notebooks I slid it out and handed it to Ki What is it A backwards photo Hold it up to the light She did and looked for a long time rapt Faint as a dream I could see my wife in her hand my wife standing on the swimming float in her twopiece suit Thats Jo I said Shes pretty Im glad to have her box for my things I am too Ki I kissed the top of her head When Sheriff Ridgewick hammered on the door I thought it wise to answer with my hands up He looked wired What seemed to ease the situation was a simple uncalculated question Wheres Alan Pangborn these days Sheriff Over New Hampshire Ridgewick said lowering his pistol a little a minute or two later he holstered it without even seeming to be aware he had done so He and Polly are doing real well Except for her arthritis Thats nasty I guess but she still has her good days A person can go along quite awhile if they get a good day every once and again thats what I think Mr Noonan I have a lot of questions for you You know that dont you Yes First off and most important do you have the child Kyra Devore Yes Where is she Ill be happy to show you We walked down the northwing corridor and stood just outside the bedroom doorway looking in The duvet was pulled up to her chin and she was sleeping deeply The stuffed dog was curled in one hand  we could just see its muddy tail poking out of her fist at one end and its nose poking out at the other We stood there for a long time neither of us saying anything watching her sleep in the light of a summer evening In the woods the trees had stopped falling but the wind still blew Around the eaves of Sara Laughs it made a sound like ancient music It snowed for Christmas a polite six inches of powder that made the carollers working the streets of Sanford look like they belonged in Its a Wonderful Life By the time I came back from checking Kyra for the third time it was quarter past one on the morning of the twentysixth and the snow had stopped A late moon plump but pale was peeking through the unravelling fluff of clouds I was Christmasing with Frank again and we were the last two up The kids Ki included were dead to the world sleeping off the annual bacchanal of food and presents Frank was on his third Scotch  it had been a threeScotch story if there ever was one I guess  but Id barely drunk the top off my first one I think I might have gotten into the bottle quite heavily if not for Ki On the days when I have her I usually dont drink so much as a glass of beer And to have her three days in a row    but shit kemo sabe if you cant spend Christmas with your kid what the hell is Christmas for Are you all right Frank asked when I sat down again and took another little token sip from my glass I grinned at that Not is she all right but are you all right Well nobody ever said Frank was stupid You shouldve seen me when the Department of Human Services let me have her for a weekend in October I must have checked on her a dozen times before I went to bed    and then I kept checking Getting up and peeking in on her listening to her breathe I didnt sleep a wink Friday night caught maybe three hours on Saturday So this is a big improvement But if you ever blab any of what Ive told you Frank  if they ever hear about me filling up that bathtub before the storm knocked the gennie out  I can kiss my chances of adopting her goodbye Ill probably have to fill out a form in triplicate before they even let me attend her highschool graduation I hadnt meant to tell Frank the bathtub part but once I started talking almost everything spilled out I suppose it had to spill to someone if I was ever to get on with my life Id assumed that John Storrow would be the one on the other side of the confessional when the time came but John didnt want to talk about any of those events except as they bore on our ongoing legal business which nowadays is all about Kyra Elizabeth Devore Ill keep my mouth shut dont worry How goes the adoption battle Slow Ive come to loathe the State of Maine court system and DHS as well You take the people who work in those bureaucracies one by one and theyre mostly fine but when you put them together     Bad huh I sometimes feel like a character in Bleak House Thats the one where Dickens says that in court nobody wins but the lawyers John tells me to be patient and count my blessings that were making amazing progress considering that Im that most untrustworthy of creatures an unmarried white male of middle age but Kis been in two fosterhome situations since Mattie died and   Doesnt she have kin in one of those neighboring towns Matties aunt She didnt want anything to do with Ki when Mattie was alive and has even less interest now Especially since     since Kis not going to be rich Yeah The Whitmore woman was lying about Devores will Absolutely He left everything to a foundation thats supposed to foster global computer literacy With due respect to the numbercrunchers of the world I cant imagine a colder charity How is John Pretty well mended but hes never going to get the use of his right arm back entirely He damned near died of bloodloss Frank had led me away from the entwined subjects of Ki and custody quite well for a man deep into his third Scotch and I was willing enough to go I could hardly bear to think of her long days and longer nights in those homes where the Department of Human Services stores away children like knickknacks nobody wants Ki didnt live in those places but only existed in them pale and listless like a wellfed rabbit kept in a cage Each time she saw my car turning in or pulling up she came alive waving her arms and dancing like Snoopy on his doghouse Our weekend in October had been wonderful despite my obsessive need to check her every half hour or so after she was asleep and the Christmas holiday had been even better Her emphatic desire to be with me was helping in court more than anything else    yet the wheels still turned slowly Maybe in the spring Mike John told me He was a new John these days pale and serious The slightly arrogant eager beaver who had wanted nothing more than to go head to head with Mr Maxwell Big Bucks Devore was no longer in evidence John had learned something about mortality on the twentyfirst of July and something about the worlds idiot cruelty as well The man who had taught himself to shake with his left hand instead of his right was no longer interested in partying til he puked He was seeing a girl in Philly the daughter of one of his mothers friends I had no idea if it was serious or not Kis Unca John is closemouthed about that part of his life but when a young man is of his own accord seeing the daughter of one of his mothers friends it usually is Maybe in the spring it was his mantra that late fall and early winter What am I doing wrong I asked him once  this was just after Thanksgiving and another setback Nothing he replied Singleparent adoptions are always slow and when the putative adopter is a man its worse At that point in the conversation John made an ugly little gesture poking the index finger of his left hand in and out of his loosely cupped right fist Thats blatant sex discrimination John Yeah but usually its justified Blame it on every twisted asshole who ever decided he had a right to take off some little kids pants if you want blame it on the bureaucracy if you want hell blame it on cosmic rays if you want Its a slow process but youre going to win in the end Youve got a clean record youve got Kyra saying I want to be with Mike to every judge and DHS worker she sees youve got enough money to keep after them no matter how much they squirm and no matter how many forms they throw at you    and most of all buddy youve got me I had something else too  what Ki had whispered in my ear as I paused to catch my breath on the steps Id never told John about that and it was one of the few things I didnt tell Frank either Mattie says Im your little guy now she had whispered Mattie says youll take care of me I was trying to  as much as the fucking slowpokes at Human Services would let me  but the waiting was hard Frank picked up the Scotch and tilted it in my direction I shook my head Ki had her heart set on snowmanmaking and I wanted to be able to face the glare of early sun on fresh snow without a headache Frank how much of this do you actually believe He poured for himself then just sat for a time looking down at the table and thinking When he raised his head again there was a smile on his face It was so much like Jos that it broke my heart And when he spoke he juiced his ordinarily faint Boston brogue Sure and Im a halfdrunk Irishman who just finished listenin to the granddaddy of all ghost stories on Christmas night he said I believe all of it you silly git I laughed and so did he We did it mostly through the nose as men are apt to do when up late maybe in their cups a little and dont want to wake the house Come on  how much really All of it he repeated dropping the brogue Because Jo believed it And because of her He nodded his head in the direction of the stairs so Id know which her he meant Shes like no other little girl Ive ever seen Shes sweet enough but theres something in her eyes At first I thought it was losing her mother the way she did but thats not it Theres more isnt there Yes I said Its in you too Its touched you both I thought of the baying thing which Jo had managed to hold back while I poured the lye into that rotted roll of canvas An Outsider she had called it I hadnt gotten a clear look at it and probably that was good Probably that was very good Mike Frank looked concerned Youre shivering Im okay I said Really Whats it like in the house now he asked I was still living in Sara Laughs I procrastinated until early November then put the Derry house up for sale Quiet Totally quiet I nodded but that wasnt completely true On a couple of occasions I had awakened with a sensation Mattie had once mentioned  that there was someone in bed with me But not a dangerous presence On a couple of occasions I have smelled or thought I have Red perfume And sometimes even when the air is perfectly still Bunters bell will shiver out a few notes Its as if something lonely wants to say hello Frank glanced at the clock then back at me almost apologetically Ive got a few more questions  okay If you cant stay up until the wee hours on Boxing Day morning I said I guess you never can Fire away What did you tell the police I didnt have to tell them much of anything Footman talked enough to suit them  too much to suit Norris Ridgewick Footman said that he and Osgood  it was Osgood driving the car Devores pet broker  did the driveby because Devore had made threats about what would happen to them if they didnt The State cops also found a copy of a wiretransfer among Devores effects at Warringtons Two million dollars to an account in the Grand Caymans The name scribbled on the copy is Randolph Footman Randolph is Georges middle name Mr Footman is now residing in Shawshank State Prison What about Rogette Well Whitmore was her mothers maiden name but I think its safe to say that Rogettes heart belonged to Daddy She had leukemia was diagnosed in  In people her age  she was only fiftyseven when she died by the way  its fatal in two cases out of every three but she was doing the chemo Hence the wig Why did she try to kill Kyra I dont understand that If you broke Sara Tidwells hold on this earthly plane of ours when you dissolved her bones the curse should have    why are you looking at me that way Youd understand if youd ever met Devore I said This is the man who lit the whole fucking TR on fire as a way of saying goodbye when he headed west to sunny California I thought of him the second I pulled the wig off thought theyd swapped identities somehow Then I thought Oh no its her all right its Rogette shes just lost her hair somehow And you were right The chemo I was also wrong I know more about ghosts than I did Frank Maybe the most important thing is that what you see first what you think first    thats whats usually true It was him that day Devore He came back at the end Im sure of it At the end it wasnt about Sara not for him At the end it wasnt even about Kyra At the end it was about Scooter Larribees sled Silence between us For a few moments it was so deep that I could actually hear the house breathing You can hear that you know If you really listen Thats something else I know now Christ he said at last I dont think Devore came east from California to kill her I said That wasnt the original plan Then what was Get to know his granddaughter Mend his fences God no You still dont understand what he was Tell me then A human monster He came back to buy her but Mattie wouldnt sell Then when Sara got hold of him he began to plan Kis death I suspect that Sara never found a more willing tool How many did she kill in all Frank asked I dont know for sure I dont think I want to Based on Jos notes and clippings Id say that there were perhaps four other    directed murders shall we call them    in the years between  and  All children all Knames all closely related to the men who killed her My God I dont think God had much to do with it    but she made them pay all right Youre sorry for her arent you Yes I would have torn her apart before I let her put so much as a finger on Ki but of course I am She was raped and murdered Her child was drowned while she herself lay dying My God arent you sorry for her I suppose I am Mike do you know who the other boy was The crying boy Was he the one who died of bloodpoisoning Most of Jos notes concerned that part of it  its where she got started Royce Merrill knew the story well The crying boy was Reg Tidwell Junior You have to understand that by September of  when the RedTops played their last show in Castle County almost everyone on the TR knew that Sara and her boy had been murdered and almost everyone had a good idea of whod done it Reg Tidwell spent a lot of that August hounding the County Sheriff Nehemiah Bannerman At first it was to find them alive  Tidwell wanted a search mounted  and then it was to find their bodies and then it was to find their killers    because once he accepted that they were dead he never doubted that theyd been murdered Bannerman was sympathetic at first Everyone seemed sympathetic at first The RedTop crowd had been treated wonderfully during their time on the TR  that was what infuriated Jared the most  and I think you can forgive Son Tidwell for making a crucial mistake What mistake was that Why he got the idea that Mars was heaven I thought The TR must have seemed like heaven to them right up until Sara and Kito went for a stroll the boy carrying his berrybucket and never came back It must have seemed that theyd finally found a place where they could be black people and still be allowed to breathe Thinking theyd be treated like regular folks when things went wrong just because theyd been treated that way when things were right Instead the TR clubbed together against them No one who had an idea of what Jared and his protgs had done condoned it exactly but when the chips were down     You protect your own you wash your dirty laundry with the door closed Frank murmured and finished his drink Yeah By the time the RedTops played the Castle County Fair their little community down by the lake had begun to break up  this is all according to Jos notes you understand theres not a whisper of it in any of the town histories By Labor Day the active harassment had started  so Royce told Jo It got a little uglier every day  a little scarier  but Son Tidwell flat didnt want to go not until he found out what had happened to his sister and nephew He apparently kept the blood family there in the meadow even after the others had taken off for friendlier locations Then someone laid the trap There was a clearing in the woods about a mile east of whats now called Tidwells Meadow it had a big birch cross in the middle of it Jo had a picture of it in her studio That was where the black community had their services after the doors of the local churches were closed to them The boy  Junior  used to go up there a lot to pray or just to sit and meditate There were plenty of folks in the township who knew his routine Someone put a leghold trap on the little path through the woods that the boy used Covered it with leaves and needles Jesus Frank said He sounded ill Probably it wasnt Jared Devore or his loggerboys who set it either  they didnt want any more to do with Sara and Sons people after the murders they kept right clear of them It might not even have been a friend of those boys By then they didnt have that many friends But that didnt change the fact that those folks down by the lake were getting out of their place scratching at things better left alone refusing to take no for an answer So someone set the trap I dont think there was any intent to actually kill the boy but to maim him Maybe see him with his foot off condemned to a lifetime crutch I think they may have gotten that far in their imagining In any case it worked The boy stepped in the trap    and for quite awhile they didnt find him The pain must have been excruciating Then the bloodpoisoning He died Son gave up He had other kids to think about not to mention the people whod stuck with him They packed up their clothes and their guitars and left Jo traced some of them to North Carolina where many of the descendants still live And during the fires of  the ones young Max Devore set the cabins burned flat I dont understand why the bodies of Sara and her son werent found Frank said I understand that what you smelled  the putrescence  wasnt there in any physical sense But surely at the time    if this path you call The Street was so popular     Devore and the others didnt bury them where I found them not to begin with They would have started by dragging the bodies deeper into the woods  maybe up to where the north wing of Sara Laughs stands now They covered them with brush and came back that night Must have been that night to leave them any longer would have drawn every carnivore in the woods They took them someplace else and buried them in that roll of canvas Jo didnt know where but my guess is Bowie Ridge where theyd spent most of the summer cutting Hell Bowie Ridge is still pretty isolated They put the bodies somewhere we might as well say there Then how    why     Draper Finney wasnt the only one haunted by what they did Frank  they all were Literally haunted With the possible exception of Jared Devore I suppose He lived another ten years and apparently never missed a meal But the boys had bad dreams they drank too much they fought too much they argued    bristled if anyone so much as mentioned the RedTops     Might as well have gone around wearing signs reading KICK US WERE GUILTY Frank commented Yes It probably didnt help that most of the TR was giving them the silent treatment Then Finney died in the quarry  committed suicide in the quarry I think  and Jareds loggerboys got an idea Came down with it like a cold Only it was more like a compulsion Their idea was that if they dug up the bodies and reburied them where it happened thingsd go back to normal for them Did Jared go along with the idea According to Jos notes by then they never went near him They reburied the bag of bones  without Jared Devores help  where I eventually dug it up In the late fall or early winter of  I think She wanted to be back didnt she Sara Back where she could really work on them And on the whole township Yes Jo thought so too Enough so she didnt want to go back to Sara Laughs once she found some of this stuff out Especially when she guessed she was pregnant When we started trying to have a baby and I suggested the name Kia how that must have scared her And I never saw Sara thought she could use you to kill Kyra if Devore played out before he could get the job done  he was old and in bad health after all Jo gambled that youd save her instead Thats what you think isnt it Yes And she was right I couldnt have done it alone From the night I dreamed about Sara singing Jo was with me every step of the way Sara couldnt make her quit No she wasnt a quitter Frank agreed and wiped at one eye What do you know about your twicegreataunt The one that married Auster Bridget Noonan Auster I said Bridey to her friends I asked my mother and she swears up and down she knows nothing that Jo never asked her about Bridey but I think she might be lying The young woman was definitely the black sheep of the family  I can tell just by the sound of Moms voice when the name comes up I have no idea how she met Benton Auster Lets say he was down in the Prouts Neck part of the world visiting friends and started flirting with her at a clambake Thats as likely as anything else This was in  She was eighteen he was twentythree They got married one of those hurryup jobs Harry the one who actually drowned Kito Tidwell came along six months later So he was barely seventeen when it happened Frank said Great God And by then his mother had gotten religion His terror over what shed think if she ever found out was part of the reason he did what he did Any other questions Frank Because Im really starting to fade For several moments he said nothing  I had begun to think he was done when he said Two others Do you mind I guess its too late to back out now What are they The Shape you spoke of The Outsider That troubles me I said nothing It troubled me too Do you think theres a chance it might come back It always does I said At the risk of sounding pompous the Outsider eventually comes back for all of us doesnt it Because were all bags of bones And the Outsider    Frank the Outsider wants whats in the bag He mulled this over then swallowed the rest of his Scotch at a gulp You had one other question Yes he said Have you started writing again I went upstairs a few minutes later checked Ki brushed my teeth checked Ki again then climbed into bed From where I lay I was able to look out the window at the pale moon shining on the snow Have you started writing again No Other than a rather lengthy essay on how I spent my summer vacation which I may show to Kyra in some later year theres been nothing I know that Harold is nervous and sooner or later I suppose Ill have to call him and tell him what he already guesses the machine which ran so sweet for so long has stopped It isnt broken  this memoir came out with nary a gasp or missed heartbeat  but the machine has stopped just the same Theres gas in the tank the sparkplugs spark and the battery bats but the wordygurdy stands there quiet in the middle of my head Ive put a tarp over it Its served me well you see and I dont like to think of it getting dusty Some of it has to do with the way Mattie died It occurred to me at some point this fall that I had written similar deaths in at least two of my books and popular fiction is heaped with other examples of the same thing Have you set up a moral dilemma you dont know how to solve Is the protagonist sexually attracted to a woman who is much too young for him shall we say Need a quick fix Easiest thing in the world When the story starts going sour bring on the man with the gun Raymond Chandler said that or something like it  close enough for government work kemo sabe Murder is the worst kind of pornography murder is let me do what I want taken to its final extreme I believe that even makebelieve murders should be taken seriously maybe thats another idea I got last summer Perhaps I got it while Mattie was struggling in my arms gushing blood from her smashed head and dying blind still crying out for her daughter as she left this earth To think I might have written such a hellishly convenient death in a book ever sickens me Or maybe I just wish thered been a little more time I remember telling Ki its best not to leave love letters around what I thought but didnt say was that they can come back to haunt you I am haunted anyway    but I will not willingly haunt myself and when I closed my book of dreams I did so of my own free will I think I could have poured lye over those dreams as well but from that I stayed my hand Ive seen things I never expected to see and felt things I never expected to feel  not the least of them what I felt and still feel for the child sleeping down the hall from me Shes my little guy now Im her big guy and thats the important thing Nothing else seems to matter half so much Thomas Hardy who supposedly said that the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones stopped writing novels himself after finishing Jude the Obscure and while he was at the height of his narrative genius He went on writing poetry for another twenty years and when someone asked him why hed quit fiction he said he couldnt understand why he had trucked with it so long in the first place In retrospect it seemed silly to him he said Pointless I know exactly what he meant In the time between now and whenever the Outsider remembers me and decides to come back there must be other things to do things that mean more than those shadows I think I could go back to clanking chains behind the Ghost House wall but I have no interest in doing so Ive lost my taste for spooks I like to imagine Mattie would think of Bartleby in Melvilles story Ive put down my scriveners pen These days I prefer not to \n"
